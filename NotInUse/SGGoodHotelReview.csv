0,LyndseyLim,3,Great location and decor. Terrible service.,"Came to The Fullerton Hotel Singapore for a business conference. The location is convenient and decor is immaculate. Would love visit this location again.   However, the service staff can be quite unhelpful, preferring to tell you ""I don't know"" instead of giving some assistance - I was trying to find a charging port for work and one of their wall ports was not working. I tried look around the lobby and instead of directing my to any functioning ports, preferred to tell me that I am not allow to sit at this or that location. Not sure if this is the kind of service I would like to bring my clients to.  I think Pan Pacific would have been a better choice."
1,John L,5,"If you want the best hotel in Singapore, this is it","We have stayed at The Fullerton a number of times previously. Never disappointed. It is truly a fabulous hotel in every aspect. This time we stayed 9 days. Our room was very clean and comfortable with great views out over Marina Bay. The bathroom was spotless, had lots of space and amenities. Our room was on the same floor as the Straits Club, so access was easy.  Nicholas, Siti and the Team at the Straits Club were as usual proactive, attentive and extremely helpful. Food and drinks were high quality and very tempting. Ryan, Chia Yi, Crystal and Zep provided exceptional service. They made our stay most enjoyable.  We took the Fullerton Heritage Tour this time. Bill the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The tour brought back wonderful memories for us, as we used to post letters…"
2,Ridhwan A,5,Wonderful staycation!,"The holistic service provided by Fullerton hotel was nothing short of perfect. From the restaurant (Courtyard) to the in-room dining service, you could tell that their staff were trained very well as it’s reflected in the impeccable service provided to me during my short stay there.  Special mention to Lalikumar (pardon if the spelling is off) from the Courtyard. His attention to detail was highly commendable. Knowing that my family and I have certain dietary restriction, he went beyond his duty to cater to us by substituting the item in our high tea set.  All and all, thank you for the awesome stay and I look forward to another superb staycation at the Fullerton hotel, hopefully in the near future ☺️."
3,jfy18fa,5,The best honeymoon start,"What a stunning hotel! The staff couldn’t have done more to help us. Our room was beautiful and the bathroom was huge! Such a lovely touch being given a delicious cake to celebrate our honeymoon. The location is fantastic- walking distance to Fullerton bay and the embankment overlooking Marina Bay Sands. The breakfast was unbelievable- we had it once as it’s quite a hefty cost, but well worth it. If we return to Singapore (which we hope to do as we loved it), we will be sure to stay here."
4,Victoria,5,Fullerton Hotel,Lovely hi-tea set.  Live entertainment with wonderful harp performance with movie and Disney soundtracks  We were happy to be served by Mr Lalikumar.  The hi-tea were exquisite and delicious with variety of tea and coffee choices.
5,Vivien T,5,Fullerton Hotel,Lalikumar is of great service and friendly . Have a great day and enjoy ourselves here. Nice music and nice ambience. Good place to enjoy with friends and family. ........Thanks alot....................
6,Sylvi Mutiara,5,Best for everything.,"Stay in Quay Room at 7th floor. Beautifull view from balcony (but I have to climb the chair for the best view). We can see the two legendary bridges, Boat Quay, Asian Civilitation Museum, Parlement House, Raffles Statue, UOB tower etc.  Beautifull view from swimming pool. And thank you for Sall (pool guard) , you are a good man, give me some information about everything.   The food, cakes are very delicious. The lunch buffet was so great. I love it.  Thank you for give a slice cake for my husband (birthday slice cake).  I love the herritage walk tour. Thank you for Linda, you are the good herritage tour guide.  Will be back again for sure."
7,DTL,4,Great location and grand hotel,Stayed for 5 nights in a premier courtyard room. Room was refurbished. Bathroom was huge by Singapore hotel standards. I kept the curtains closed most of the time. I picked the Fullerton because I like hotels that have character. A lot of 5 star hotels in my opinion are soulless and the same. The location was fabulous for the things that interest me. Being so close to the Merlion and waterways was great. The train station is so close as well. The staff that stood out for me were the concierge and front door man. Sharing tips on quickest transportation routes etc. Breakfast was plentiful but I do wish it went to 11am instead of 10:30am. I like to sleep in on holidays. I was able to use facilities after check out such as showering which is extremely helpful when flights are late…
8,909LCWM,5,Fullerton Suite with family of four,We booked a 1 night weekday staycation at the Fullerton for our family of four. The hotel is beautifully presented and the lobby staff are helpful and friendly. Check in was quick and easy. We received a upgraded suite on arrival (we were not told it was an upgrade at the desk but from the website pictures it looked like the Fullerton Suite). The suite had an very big balcony and a view onto the river and partially onto the bay/mbs. The main bed is very comfortable and my kids slept well on the sofa bed and additional roll out.  The service at the straits club was excellent and i particularly want to commend Crystal and Ryan for their attentiveness and level of service. Tip for the club level: check-in is at 3pm but first seating for afternoon tea is 1:30-3pm so if you wanted to…

15,Jen,5,Fabulous stay with family,"My first stay at The Fullerton Hotel and I’m deeply impressed by the service, cleanliness and everything! Checkin was seamless and quick, and receptionist is considerate to ask me if my child is allowed ice cream before offering my 4 years old a name tag with lanyard (entitles her for 2 rounds of ice cream), crayons and activity book. My girl broke her crayons and was upset, and the receptionist happily offered her a new set together with the activity book much to her delight. When I called for a ‘flat’ pillow for my child, we were given a child pillow instead (which is exactly what we wished for), and we didn’t have to wait long for them to come over too. And impressively, we were greeted when we called for service. Wifi was speedy, although we don’t really need it. The…"
16,BrettB,5,Singapore Holiday,"Another stay at The Fullerton Singapore, our 4th visit. It is always sad to leave the Fullerton because you feel so pampered during your stay. The staff are exceptional, friendly and never fail to go the extra mile to ensure that guests feel totally spoilt. The Fullerton is a classic colonial experience, centrally located and the perfect base to explore Singapore. My wife & I love escaping Australia’s cold winter and spending a week or so at the beautiful & friendly Fullerton Hotel in Singapore. We can’t wait to return :)"
17,Prakash B,4,"Heritage building, great location","Visited Singapore first time in August 22 post pandemic and stayed at this beautiful heritage hotel at the central location near financial district, While the external facade maintains its heritage character, it is quite modern internally.  Had a smooth check in and check out experience, the rooms are large specious and have all the modern amenities The breakfast spread is excellent, the overall service levels are very good. The location of the hotel is excellent overlooking the Singapore river, with walking distance to financial district and Boat quay. The hotel is expensive and despite paying $ 400 we were given rooms on the internal side, overall if you like heritage building at central location it is great option in Singapore."
18,Laurel L,5,Fullerton Singapore,"We have been to Singapore many times and really love the place.  This time we treated ourselves to the Fullerton as on our other visits we would always come here for coffee.  Our room was beautiful and comfortable and housekeeping were very good.  We would like to give special thanks to Crystal, Ryan, Siti, Zep, Chiayi and Nicholas for their wonderful service in the Straits Cluba d of course the chef for the great food.  The atmosphere there was very relaxing and friendly.  Would definitely recommend a stay at this beautiful Hotel."
19,Peer,5,Excellence service!,"This is my first time staying in Fullerton Hotel. The services are excellence. The team at the lounge is so professional and caring :)  Esp Nicholas - who remembered my meeting schedules and arranged for my breakfasts swiftly just to ensure that I have enough time for my meal and preparation for the meeting and also Crystal who gave me a memorable service - she gave me a scarf so that I won’t get cold, she remembered my favorite tea and always got me the perfect table (where the plugs are available) :))  Lastly, Juliet, the house keeping team, also saved my day by locating my missing Airpod case in the room. I literally didn’t expect that the hotel will find it (as I looked for it everywhere in the room (including the trash) lol).  I really enjoyed and had a pleasant stay here."

25,Mark T,5,21 year reunion!  5 star all the way ✨️,"Having spent many months working in Singapore and staying at the Fullerton, I can honestly say it's improved on greatness.  We had a gorgeous view, stunning breakfast and Christine and her staff were impeccable. We even got to shower and rest before our 1am flight after checking out.  While it's a lot to spend, you're worth it."
26,VLT,3,"Great view, great location but not so clean","Great view & convenient location. Not recommended for families. We went for a staycation as a family.   Average Service by front desk - great service by checking out staff, not so pleasant experience with checking in staff.   Great service provided by staff at the restaurant where we had our breakfast. They were very welcoming and serving staff were very attentive and friendly  Plumbing issues - The bathtub was not able to drained out the water. We called the helpdesk and the plumber came to fix it. Took about 45-60mins.   Spider webs on fixtures.   Cleaniness of the room - Given the rather positive reputation of the hotel, we expected a little more but was quite disappointed. We requested for a baby cot but it was not so clean, we decided not to use it in the end. It was torn…"
27,Benjamin T,5,Luxurious stay!,"Hotel room was excellent, with stunning views of Marina Bay.

Even though my last stay was Jan last year, she recongise us and remember about our last visit. It feels like coming to a home. She ensure that the room has the best view and clean before handing the keys to us. The room was flawless with an amazing view. Her services is top notch perfect! Even during check out, i was served by another staff, she came to us and ask if everything is ok. She is definitely a gem of a hotel!"

38,Zen,5,National Day Weekend Celebration at the Fullerton Hotel,"We stayed here for a short vacation during Singapore's National Day.

We received National day themed chocolates on the night before NDP. Overall, service was top notch. We would like to say thank you to the front office team who were very helpful all the way from the doorman, concierge and at the front desk. We hope to return next year to soak in the atmosphere."

55,Priscilla,5,Cordial and Satisfying Service,"Have been received by warm and friendly staffs at The Fullerton Hotel and is especially impressed by the service provided at the guest lounges. My partner and I were served by Crystal, Ryan and Marcel who have all been helpful and courteous the entire time we were there. Crystal was very knowledgeable about the hotel and surrounding areas which helped us in finding our way to MBS. While the atmosphere and beverages served at the lounge were wonderful, the food, however, was slightly bland for me but was alright for my partner. Given the chance again, I would come back for another stay."
56,Daniel,4,National Day 🍾,"Stayed at the Fullerton Suite for National Day preview. The suite was huge and gorgeous. Taking this opportunity to thank the outstanding team members such as Joshua Liu, Lisa and Kate from reception who had helped to make check in and out as seemless as possible.   The staff from Straits Club were also very prompt and provided exceptional service. They also took note of our preferences very well. Thank you Nicholas, Siti, Lucy, Jared.   Housekeeping was also very prompt in responding to our requests. Kar Wei, Mike and Simon were very professional and assisted us in their best way possible.  Thank you Fullerton for the great memories formed."
57,C S,5,Stayed for fireworks,"Had a great stay here at the fullerton, and an excellent view of the fireworks Very good location if it fits your itinerary Would like to thank Jared Marcel Lucy and Crystal for their hospitality at the straits club. They were friendly and welcoming, had a good time with the food and drink selection throughout the sessions in the day We tried a variety of items across the days Great service overall and we had a good time"
58,Giveitagonow7,4,"Comfortable, well located for business and renovated rooms.","Super location in the middle of CBD, if travelling for business. The room I stayed in had been renovated and was lovely (if without a window!). The service was generally good. The pool was very nice. The breakfast is fullsome.  Housekeeping was a little patchy with repeated reminders to get some earl grey tea not acted on. And in room dining stops at 10! They won’t even get you a hot chocolate after that time. But these are small niggles."
59,Romelu L,5,SUPER CLEAN,"Wonderful small Boutique Hotel in the center of Palau , amongst Restaurants Bars right in front of the harbor.  They nail the most important factor, Super Clean , great beds and good breakfast. We have stayed in the Wellness suite , very elegant with Technogym accessories  At the bar they have great cocktails   Will be back for sure next year"
