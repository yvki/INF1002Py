0,Johannes R,4,Easy stay,This hotel is easy and is in 10-15min walking distance either to Aljunied or Kallang station. So very close to the center and Marina bay. I can highly recommend Kampong Glam with the mosque and Haji lane.
1,Rosanne H,2,Hornbill hotel - not great,"We stayed here for 4 nights and our first time to Singapore. The price was in our budget and you pay for what you get. the hotel is very small and the rooms are very dated and shabby. could do with re painting and basic upgrading at least. Our room wasn’t veey clean and we had some creepy crawlies join us, particularly in rhe bathroom. the receptionists were friendly and helpful though and the location is OK ( 10 minute walk to nearest MRT station for city centre ) food and mini markets nearby."
2,Green Light,4,Always Looks at Other Reviews on Other Platforms,"Always re-reviews the reviews you read, refers also the photos submitted by user.   I booked the hotel through another platforms and my opinions for this hotel is REALLY AWESOME.  I think I'm one of the lucky costumers since my trouble is only met 2 tiny little cockroaches and 1 flies on the bed, then I just throw it off from the bed. As simple as that then they didn't appear again in my second night.   The hotel is walkable from Kallang MRT Station, about 15 minutes and really walkable to the 2 nearest bus stops (Opp Masjid Mohd Salleh, and one more).  "
3,Baaarmiin,2,I guess the other reviews made the point,"I think the other reviews already described most of the experience but i'll just add some more:  Pros: Near bus stops, a wide selection of hawkers and convenience stores Ok if you are not a picky guest, and just in for a short term stay Dirt cheap  Cons:  As the saying goes, what you pay for, what you get. It's an old hotel. The tv doesent work Only one power outlet out of 6 power outlets work, so you got to have a super fast charger to charge all your gadgets The cr door doesnt work. Yeah, bummer  If you are lookinf for class and luxury, stay away. But if you are just a happy back packer who just want an affordable bed and bath, this is for you."
4,Felipe K,1,Not at a good hotel at all,"The room we got for ourselves didn't look like what we saw on agoda, there was mold on the walls and cockroaches everywhere. We asked to cancel the room because we wanted to find something better, however, they suggested a change of room and we accepted. The new room was slightly better, however, cockroaches were still everywhere, and the conditioner would start making an incredible loud rattling noise out of nowhere in the middle of the night, so we had to turn it off and on again multiple times."
5,Alberto R,1,Cockroach infested!,"My stay was terrible. This place was cockroach infested. When I looked under the bed I noticed a few cockroaches, normally not too big a deal, this is after all a very warm climate and its understandable. But upon further inspection, I noticed that the bed side table was infested with them. At night they started coming out of the bathroom sink and shower. I was dumb enough to leave my laptop on the bedside table (before I noticed how bad it was) and I just saw another one crawl out of my laptop (this is the 5th) and I am back at home. Honestly, worse thing is that now I am scared as to what I brought back with me.   The room was a little dirty, my bedsheet had a couple of stains and one fresh one, that I managed to rub off, so maybe the sheets had not been washed?  The location…"
6,Sophie T,1,DO NOT BOOK HERE!,"This place is one of the worst hotels I have been too! Firstly we did our laundry, only to be told that someone has poured bleach on our clothes so about 6 items have been ruined and have had to go in the bin. We got compensated our $8 back but that’s it. They had bugs all over the room including the bed which was disgusting. There was also a sign in the lift saying they had pest control coming in the following day, so they know that that there is a problem with bugs throughout the hotel. There were pubic hairs in the bathroom and so much hair on the bed and blanket. We were in the room for about an hour in total before deciding we could not stay in this horrific place. For a budget room I still expect it to be clean, but this place was so far from. when checking out we told…"
7,Piotr S,1,I've never been in place like that,"If You don't want to have a diesese don't visit this place. Rooms are terrible. Dirt and mould is everywhare, We had a blood on the wall and wholes on the flor. The bed was covered with black hair. There was also an extreem stench. Compareing to another budget hotels in eighborhood this was the worst. Overal rate -1."
8,Subhendhu S,5,"For the amount they charge and the quality they provide, I feel its a best option to stay.","For the amount they charge, I feel its a best option to stay. Its actually best for those who came Singapore for tour and will be roaming whole day outside and just need a good comfortable, air conditioned, neat and clean small shelter just for night.  Pros :- Cost wise very budgeted. Friendly Staff. Good Privacy. You will get your room cleaned everyday with two glasses of water everyday. Locality is very good. Kallang MRT in walk able distance. Its the area where you get many 24 hours open restaurant, food court and other shops. You can keep luggage after check out if your flight is little late.  Cons :- Rooms are very neat and clean but slightly small in size (may be approx. 10 X 9 feet in size I think). So it may be slightly uncomfortable for some people as you cannot scatter…"
9,Bogdan O,2,Can't Recomend,"We where in this hotel only for 1 night and we randomly booked it without making any research,we found the hotel not so clean and everything looks very old.The rooms are very small. Location is ok around 15 minute walk to the metro and in the area there are shops and restaurants from what we seen."

15,AngItimNaRosas,5,Simple yet comfy,"Singapore was a 18-hour stopover for my Maldives trip thru Scoot. Since it will arrive in SG at 1am but will fly out by 7:30pm, my friends and I wanted to catch up some sleep before our last leg of the trip.  When searching for affordable hotels, we came across this one. We're able to get double-bed room and costed us ~P1700/room, so its 800/pax. We got 2 separate rooms.  We arrived past 3am, since we ate first at the airport (we got so hungry), and was greeted by the  receptionist. Since my other friend bailed out on me, I had to stay on a different room by myself, on a different floor; mine's at the 4th and husband-wife tandem on the 3rd.   When I entered the room, i saw a flicker on the lights but it wont light up. I called the receptionist and he found that the bathroom…"
16,Stella Nguyen,1,So horrible,"Furnitures are old. Firstly, I did think it’s not too bad because the room is old but quite clean. But I did have to regret when I went out for a while then came back n saw there were so many small cockroaches running on my bed 😱😱😱 even though I still kept the light turning on. So horrible. There was only one good thing is friendly staff. But 100% I will never choose it again. "
17,Chong y,1,Dont even think about it,"For the sake of your health, please leave this hotel off your choice. The hotel was not ever once maintained at all. There literally COCKROACHES everywhere around your bed, especially under bed where you couldnt see but they would pop up crawling on your bed. Everything is dirty as hell and water marks are everywhere. I repeat: COCKROACHES ARE EVERYWHERE. The receptionist don't even bother and gave us a bottle of insect sprayer to settle and the second receptionist just casually node head and while we are complaining before literally leaving and rebooked another hotel. I guess the water leaking issue/noisy surronding wouldn't be worth mention at all. This is the hotel for escort only took have a small meeting , it's not even qualify as a basic hotel."
18,Antzgiler,4,Basic Hotel for Budget Travelers,"Basic but adequate, great for travelers who need to budget-travel but want the privacy of a single room instead of a hostel. In fact the price of a standard double room is cheaper than the price for 2 pax at even the cheapest hostel!  I stayed in the standard double room, they provided water, a kettle, cups, bath towels, basic toiletries, water heater, a TV...honestly that's all I need! Of cos there's also free WiFi. And you can rent a hair dryer for SGD 1!! it's so much easier than carrying a hair dryer around for light packers! Also their staff are friendly and helpful. all-in-all, if you are not overly fussy, and you need a good budget hotel at great prices, then do stay at Hornbill Hotel!"
19,Arielleeeee_c,4,Good budget hotel,"It's a really nice budget hotel if you need a place to rest. It provides simple amenities for you such as toothbrush, towels and shower cap.  The bed is okay, not of high quality and there are cable channels. However, there weren't good signals for some channels. There were lingering cigarette's smoke smell in the room. The cleanliness is mediocre but the good point is that the staffs are really friendly and helpful, especially the manager.   You can purchase discounted attraction tickets from their front desk. The location is very good if you're a supper person as there are many shops selling delicious and cheap food in the vicinity and they open throughout the night!"

25,CityJudge,1,Unthinkably Poor.,"This hotel has everything unthinkably poor.  The room door lock is loose; half of the wall power sockets are fake, shaky, and either powerless or blocked inside; missing ceiling lightbulb is replaced with a lump of toilet paper; insects are crawling and the excretion of insects can be seen everywhere on the floor, inside the drawer and even on the towels; towels are torn and dirty; no dress cabinet but just one hanger hooked to the power cable of a tube TV for hanging clothes; walls and floors are cracked, leaked and dripping; no shower curtain; one dusty roll of toilet paper is provided but the toilet roll holder is broken..., Just to name a few.  Totally unacceptable.  For the sake of Singapore's reputation, this hotel should be banned."
26,Rachelyap_MY,2,Worst experience,"first visit in 2007 until last year, everything is good until the recent trip. we check in room 304 and it turned out to be the worst stay ever. wifi is none, room corner can find unswipe paper & hair, the seat bow in the toilet has stained and surrounding has leftover debris. Towel condition is as good as my house old floor mat and the room is full of cigi smell. Last visit in 2015 i still can see some foreign tourist but now i only see immigrant + their gf check in. Didnt bother to change as payment has been made and only wan 6h sleep. Will explore other hotel surrounding that area instead of this hotel"
27,Danny H,3,Just ok hotel,"The room is clean on the first night, but from the second night, they don't make up the room, the facility in room is poor, the staff is so so. In the night, it is very noisy. The noise comes from surrounding area: bar, other hotels."
28,DoDidDone,1,Terrible Experience in Singapore,"I stayed at this hotel for a couple days.  For the day I arrived, the lift was broken down and I needed to take my heavy luggage to my room by myself (this problem had been fixed on the next day).  My room was very small and very dirty. The bed frame was broken and I could feel the spring underneath that made me didn't sleep well all these days.  The bathroom had some dark stains, this hotel provided soap only (no shampoo) and didn't provide enough toilet paper (bring your own toilet paper?).  Each floor had some instructions in wifi usage, however, the SSID can't be located by my mobile phone all the times.  I told the staff that the wifi didn't work and he told me he would fix it later.  The wifi worked ""fine"" later but the connection wasn't stable and disconnected easily. …"
29,Sari,3,Just Ok,"Stay over a night after arrived at changi airport at 00.30 am. Hotel just ok. we just stay 6 hours before move to another hotel, small room, no wifi connection at 5th floor even front desk said there's wifi spot."

For me, it was just in the way. I don't remember what it's purpose was, but I asked them to remove it for me.  If I had known then what I know now, I would have stayed at the hostel, and rented a room by the hour (for my brief Honeymoon), rather than stay there.  Would I stay there again? Not likely, however, if it was my only option I would.  It's not far from the MRT station, and it's right on the bus line.  I was there in December 18, 19, and 20 of 2014"

45,Rachelyap_MY,4,My regular hotel,"My stay was prior to CNY holiday and these are my new experience staying in this hotel: 1) very responsive email follow up & correspondence on room inquiry and booking 2) Clean and tidy room 3) friendly frontoffice 4) parking spot ( i drove to SG) 5) lots of food along the Geylang road  My advice: (1) red light district ard Geylang area hence not recommended to single gal/ female only. (2) Two MRT stations (Kallang & Aljunied) are far away from hotel (min 10mins walk for Kallang & over 15 mins for Aljunied). It would be easier to go to town by bus. (3) very basic toiletries (toothbrush, towel & soap)"
46,tntcrews,3,basic and a bit tired but very good value,"We had been warned that the area was the red light district but we saw no evidence of it even at midnight. The area was lively , bustling with locals in the cafes and shops. It seemed more authentic than 'the chinatown' There were several restaurants where the food was excellent and very cheap. There were several late night shops .it is further out but within 2 minutes of the bus stop and 10 from the nearest MRT. The hotel was slightly away from the busiest road and quiet at night. The entrance was staffed 24 hrs by welcoming and helpful staff. Our room was small  and tired but it had everything we needed . The linnen was reasonable but the matress could do with renewing. The shower room was tiny but the water hot. The price was very good ,especially by Singapore standards."
47,Ninjawarden,3,Budget hotel with bare necessities,"This is as budget as you can get. Nothing fancy about the facilities. A room with a bed and a working TV and shower. Nonetheless, the staff was very helpful and offered to upgrade our room for just SGD3 per night. The location is very good, with easy access to transportation and food. The major complaint would be the WiFi that was not working throughout our stay."
48,Mark B,1,More of a brothel than a hotel,"It was clear to me that this was a budget hotel - with budget I expect simple, small with minimum facilities- somewhere to put one's head down, and spend little time at, before touring the city in the day. I paid for 5 nights to stay and watch the F1. On arrival, I was met by friendly staff and taken to a room which was claimed to be accessible for a wheelchair user like myself, however they seemed to forget about the large step into the bathroom and the other large step over into the shower - totally inaccessible and should I have stayed would not have been able to use the toilet or the shower. That being said the management did offer to get carpenter to build a ramp which would mean a day or 2 without facilities, but the point is this should have been made clear from my email…"
49,scorpio12an,5,HAPPY HOTEL IS DEFINATELY HAPPY IN ALL WAYS,"Yes., I have stayed at this Hotel & HAPPY HOTEL IS DEFINATELY HAPPY and value for money is an understatement .... Located close to bus., MRT and restaurants/facilities ~ with a gr8 team of staff ...... WOWWWWW ..... A perfect stay !"
50,Rachelyap_MY,4,My regular hotel,"My stay was prior to CNY holiday and these are my new experience staying in this hotel: 1) very responsive email follow up & correspondence on room inquiry and booking 2) Clean and tidy room 3) friendly frontoffice 4) parking spot ( i drove to SG) 5) lots of food along the Geylang road  My advice: (1) red light district ard Geylang area hence not recommended to single gal/ female only. (2) Two MRT stations (Kallang & Aljunied) are far away from hotel (min 10mins walk for Kallang & over 15 mins for Aljunied). It would be easier to go to town by bus. (3) very basic toiletries (toothbrush, towel & soap)"
51,tntcrews,3,basic and a bit tired but very good value,"We had been warned that the area was the red light district but we saw no evidence of it even at midnight. The area was lively , bustling with locals in the cafes and shops. It seemed more authentic than 'the chinatown' There were several restaurants where the food was excellent and very cheap. There were several late night shops .it is further out but within 2 minutes of the bus stop and 10 from the nearest MRT. The hotel was slightly away from the busiest road and quiet at night. The entrance was staffed 24 hrs by welcoming and helpful staff. Our room was small  and tired but it had everything we needed . The linnen was reasonable but the matress could do with renewing. The shower room was tiny but the water hot. The price was very good ,especially by Singapore standards."
52,Ninjawarden,3,Budget hotel with bare necessities,"This is as budget as you can get. Nothing fancy about the facilities. A room with a bed and a working TV and shower. Nonetheless, the staff was very helpful and offered to upgrade our room for just SGD3 per night. The location is very good, with easy access to transportation and food. The major complaint would be the WiFi that was not working throughout our stay."
53,Mark B,1,More of a brothel than a hotel,"It was clear to me that this was a budget hotel - with budget I expect simple, small with minimum facilities- somewhere to put one's head down, and spend little time at, before touring the city in the day. I paid for 5 nights to stay and watch the F1. On arrival, I was met by friendly staff and taken to a room which was claimed to be accessible for a wheelchair user like myself, however they seemed to forget about the large step into the bathroom and the other large step over into the shower - totally inaccessible and should I have stayed would not have been able to use the toilet or the shower.

55,Carla Y,3,Great Staff,"I always go for a spotless clean bathroom with hot and cold powerful showers and blazing cold air conditioner when i book hotel rooms and this one i got in New Happy Hotel :)  The room was small but the double bed was clean and comfortable; TV had cable.  Phone worked but wifi was erratic.  Place was quiet and elevator was swift. Room was cleaned everyday, towels changed, bottled water given everyday too :))  Staff were great!  Always with ready smile and offered information pretty swiftly.    Place is close to bus stop and food shops."
56,JKerching,2,'Happy Ending' Hotel!,"There are only 2 reasons why I've given this place a poor rather than a terrible; 1) The staff were really friendly and helpful 2) the shower was hot and ridiculously powerful - if you put it on full whack it would literally launch itself round the room, which is always a good thing in my book. The reasons then I give it a poor rating 1) The Bug Life - on arriving we found out we hadn't been given a room for two but in fact a dormitory for cockroaches. Now I've seen by fair share of bugs in hotels, but this was an invasion. You had everything from your finger nail size to your fist size. I think the only reason we didn't leave immediately,  and instead began on a search and destroy cockroach policy, was, as mentioned, because the shower was amazing. 2) Stained bed sheets and…"
57,abby1798,5,"friendly/accomodating staff, cleanliness is here","been here this month of May for a week right every after meetings. it was a great experienced i had with the staff , management and even the room cleaners was so courteous to check what i need each day.  seeing everytime i went down to the lobby area those smiling receptionist saying ""HI""...and even very helpful on giving such information i needed on how to get into another place.. ...just a wonderful experienced to have new friends here!!    see u on my  next visit buddies!                                                                                             Dr. Abby C."
58,Emily C,2,Crap for the price,"The room was very small. The AC leeked and was loud, so we couldnt sleep with it on. Dodgy area, near red light district with pervy men. Unhelpful staff. Uncomfortable pillows.  but. You do get a bottle of water free each per day."
59,Rob S,4,Travelling couple,"So, arriving in Singapore after 4 months travelling around southeast Asia and you have to adjust your spending habits a little. We booked happy hotel in advance to save the hassle of arriving in a city and then not knowing where to go. From the airport it was an easy run on the MRT getting off at EW10. 10minute walk to the hotel from the station.  The hotel is within the 'red light district' but apart from some short skirts, it isn't much to write home about. It certainly felt quite safe all the while we were there (5 nights).  We stayed on the 6th floor. Room was small 10ft square, but clean. Bathroom was also small but clean. Fresh towels daily and bottled water. Air con worked and was almost silent. Space was a bit of an issue as there was 2 of us carrying a lot of luggage (2…"
