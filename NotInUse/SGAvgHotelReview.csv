0,ehj,3,Interesting Area,One of the best location in bugis area. I've been here 6x and i love staying this place. MRT and bus stop is few meters away from the hotel. Temples and night market is just outside the hotel once you steep out..
1,ulyssaelaine,4,Very good location and budget friendly hotel,"The location is very nice because it's just a walking distance from Bugis MRT. There are many eateries around the hotel, too.   The hotel accommodation already comes with a daily breakfast. You can choose either Continental or Vegetarian.   The triple room is bigger enough for us (family) considering it's a budget hotel.  The staffs are friendly, too.  The cons that I think of is the WiFi is very costly. How I wish the WiFi is free but nevertheless, the WiFi speed is quite good."
2,blokototerminous,3,"Basic, dated lodging in excellent location","This is my usual accommodation in Singapore because of its ideal location in Bugis on a pedestrian-only section of Waterloo St. and its budget pricing (for the location). But the hotel is a throwback to a different era and seems to be slowly fading. The pros: within easy walking distance of two MRT stations, Bugis Junction and other shopping centers, and a good  Albert hawker center. And I've walked to the National Museum, National Gallery, Singapore Art Museum, and National Library within 20 minutes. In the other direction, Little India and the Arab quarter are also within walking distance. Nearby bus lines will take you to Orchard Road or Chinatown.  The cons: the hotel dates from the 1950s and, despite some renovations and cleanliness, shows its age -- occasional plumbing,…"
3,darmaatmadjasyela,3,really worth it,"on dec 2016, i stayed at South East asia, i booked 1 triple room i think it's a worth it hotel , they have enough big room, toilet, air conditioning.  don't think you get a modern and newest room, but this hotel enough for me because the room are clean.  , the great location near from bugis street  &beside kuan im temple and many food around this hotel , the hotel gave us breakfast you can choose continental breakfast or oriental breakfast.  they don't give you free wi fi, you must pay for the wi fi connection"
4,cheddarclouds,1,"Bad Experience, Unfriendly Staff","I will never forget the time I stayed here with my sister. Why? Because it was terrible. Although they offered free breakfast--which has limited choices--I must say that the rooms were old. The staff were unfriendly. There was no WiFi.   And because of them, we missed our flight back to our country. On our last day, my sister used the kettle provided in the room to reheat her soup. When we checked out, they found out about it. They were so mad that they didn't allow us to leave until my sister washed the kettle. As we were in a hurry to leave for the airport and didn't want to argue with them, my sister agreed to wash the kettle. After she washed it, they looked at the kettle and asked her to wash it again. We told them we have a plane to catch but still they asked her to wash…"
5,Cassy B,3,"Budget friendly, great location","If you are looking for a cheap place to stay in the city with easy access to the train station, then this maybe a good option for you.  Surrounded by hawker places, also very near to the infamous Bugis shopping area.  Rooms are a little old and beds are just OK. But the price is very reasonable, you get what you pay for I guess. It comes with a vegetarian breakfast buffet. We booked a room for 3 people and room size is big enough.  They only accept cash, so make sure you are ready with that. And they don't have free wifi.  Overall, if you need a cheap place to stay then this maybe a good option for you."
6,Christopher Choo,3,Okay-ish stay,The price was decent and the location was great. However the hotel did not provide free WIFI and I had to buy coupons to use the WIFI and they were ungodly expensive. Breakfast was more or less okay but not satisfying due to the shortage of choice (very limited). The man at the counter was friendly though.
7,Serena W,4,Great Location,"We stayed at this hotel the second time, this time in a family room @$160SGD. We found the size of the family room = double room we stayed before. The staff were very friendly and efficient and room clean. However we noticed the aircond had a lot of dust on it. Daughter very sensitive to dust and had to give her antihistamine that night.  Easy access to vegetarian food & Bugis shopping.  Vegetarian breakfast was provided (either Continental or Western).  I think for the price, it is well worth it. But hope they can maybe clean up the aircond.  Bring your own slippers as the bathroom floor can be wet after someone showers."
8,morris w,4,A hidden gem in an excellent location at a very reasonable cost,Having been to Singapore previously I found Hotel costs in the main exceeded my budget   On my last visit I found this hotel as it backed onto where I was staying in Belconnen St   It is very small [about 3 stories] and was built in 1953 however extensive renovations have been made in the last few years and overall we found it acceptable and comfortable   A normal double room is $100 per night but we paid $120 per night for a larger room with sofa desk etc as weather was quite humid and the extra space was helpful when returning to the hotel [note no credit cards are accepted and room must be paid for daily in cash This caused us no concerns]   Our room had all things we needed [air conditioning ensuite etc]   The room was spotlessly clean a requirement of my wife  It was…
9,twofeathersSingapore,1,It's Very Hard To Like This Place,"I chose this place for its central location and convenience which turned out to be really inconvenient and leaves a lot to be desired. I moved in and out 3 times due to day trips out of Singapore. Each time there were challenges with luggages. There was inconsistencies. I was charged on 2 occasion and was not on one occasion. My stay consist of lots of asking of deposits and payments for my stays - All the time when I walked through front desk. It was trying but I tried to ignore them and get on with my stay. Rooms were outdated, dirty and dim. There is no blanket of any sort, just a sheet over your bed. Really cold in the middle of the night. I had to use a chair to manually off the air-con when it got too cold and vice versa.   Breakfast was nothing to look forward to. Its…"

15,Jesheril,2,Nice location but...,"Very nice location but room is old and not well maintained. Carpeted floor is dirty. The receptionist was kind enough to give us an air freshener when we complained that that the room smells like cigarette smoke. The bathroom is okay, but we found a cockroach on the floor. The kettle, cups, saucers and spoons were all dirty. This is probably one of the cheapest hotels in Singapore so don't expect too much. Hope they will do something about this as the hotel has a very nice location. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our visit to Singapore! "
16,Vineet B,4,Great location !,"This place is very nicely located near to bust stops and Bugis MRT (5 mins walk). Vegetarians restaurant can be found at fortune center just next door. The complementary breakfast was only okay, but the location kind of makes up for it. They would only accept daily cash for room rent to confirm your reservation. "
17,christinar397,3,Big family room and near Bugis,"The 1st time we were here was on Apr 2014. We had a pleasant stay, the family room was big, however the room was outdated but that was not a problem for us. And in last Apr, we stayed here too. We had a family room, and got different room. It was smaller but still big enough compare to other hotels, and the room was much much better than we had last year, it looked like being renewed. The location is near Bugis street market and there's food centre nearby too. The Bugis MRT is about 10 min walking, and there is a bus stop behind the hotel, which we can go directly to Sentosa/Vivocity mall. We loved the location and def will be back if visiting Singapore with family. "
18,puribungalombok,5,"Best value for money you can get in Singapore, spaceous rooms, excellent location","The hotel is located within 3 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station, Bugis Junction, Sim Lim Square and only 10 minutes walk to Little India. For food there are several hawker locations with cheap and great Asian food. The rooms are for Singapore standards spacious, clean and comfortable. I stay here at least 3 or 4 times a year both for business and holiday purposes. The breakfast is both (asian) vegetarian and continental and good enough to start the day. You could always walk just 3 minutes across the road past OG to the Fairprice supermarket and get your yoghurt. The staff too are very kind and helpful. Don't waste time looking for the big chains as then you will just get your own little cubicle for this pricetag."

25,Erik H,2,Good location,The location is what is good about this hotel.  The room is OK but there was a smell in the room from the carpet.   There is WiFi internet but it's not free. I cost like it's still the 20th century. SG$6 for one hour. And you have to use the whole hour at once.   I Think you can find a better hotel for this price. 
26,Serena W,4,"Great Location, Helpful Staff, Very Happy","My mum and I had a great 3 days stay in SEA Hotel SG 5-8/12/14. We choose this Hotel because it is in the best location for vegetarian food (all within walking location) and we can just walk to Pray at the Kwan Imm Temple & Indian Temple next door.Breakfast on the sunday morning we had Char Siew Bao, fried noodle, it was good (you can choose Western or Continental Buffet).  Staff helpful, room cleaned and towels changed every day.  Tips : Bring slippers bec shower room can be a bit wet.          Superior Room has hairdryer and small bar fridge (we had Choc as souvenirs so we opt for this room)  We are very happy with our stay. Will stay at same place again for our next trip."
27,Sanjeev,3,"Basic Hotel, Good location, Value for money.","This is a nice budget hotel, but people may get better and newer hotels at a little more than the tariff of this hotel. The plus for this hotel might be a good location and secondly bigger rooms. Location is very strategic at Bugis, which is a nice for shopping and hawker food. Bugis MRT is about 7 minutes walk.   We stayed in Quadruplicate room. Room was huge and bathroom was neat and clean. The thing which I did not liked was the ambiance and getup of the room. It was not inviting. I presume the Deluxe Room or Rooms on the upper floors might be having better ambiance.   The Breakfast was quite good with choice of 2 varieties.   Its a good hotel for the price it charges and is full value for money in the expensive Singapore."
28,JamesB00n,4,Good Location and Clean,Been staying at the hotel every time we go Singapore. This hotel located at Bugis. Very strategic location where the LRT station is just nearby. You no need to worried about food because Albert Food Center is just few meters away from the hotel.  Pros : Very strategic location is you want to go shopping at Bugis and local food are easily accessible.  Cons : do not received credit card payment. We have to pay cash for the room.

35,zengu05,4,Good hotel for the price,"Don't expect the quality or service like a normal hotel or you will be disappointed; this is a budget hotel (and it's ~60 years old!). But what you get for the prices that are charged is very reasonable and quite good value for money. If you want to stay in Singapore on the cheap and just need a clean, convenient place to stay, I recommend this hotel. Payment is done in cash only, but can be done daily, so you don't need to fork it out all at once. (And, if necessary, gives you the choice to move to another hotel.)  I went with my partner and the room we had was quite spacious (~22 metres squared), with a separate (combined) toilet/shower. (FYI, this is common for homes in Singapore.) There was plenty of room to lay down both out luggage bags and walk about. Our room had a…"

The hotel's quite old but it's fine with us, our room was big and it faces the road with the view of the flower vendors just outside of the hotel.  Very convenient location because it's walking distance from the train station. There are lots of food stalls in the area as well.   They serve buffet breakfast with the same food selection everyday. We didn't mind because it's complimentary breakfast. They also allowed us to leave our baggage after check-out because our flight's in the evening.   We'll definitely stay here again when we come back in SG."

But hey, it's a budget hotel, so we cannot really ask for more. Oh yes, when we found out that the jug was not working on the second day of our stay - guess what?

58,Drishti111,3,SEA Hotel,"My family stayed at SEA Hotel last 13-16 September 2013. The location is excellent as it is a mere ten minute walk from the MRT Bugis station. Along the way, you see a lot of bargain shops and fruit stalls. It was mid-autumn festival when we arrived and so the streets were lined up with stalls selling mooncakes! The hotel is beside a Buddhist temple surrounded by vendors selling beautiful flowers. The best part is that the hotel is very near hawker stalls that sell yummy and cheap SG eats!  The hotel is average. We stayed in the family room. The couple who run the hotel are friendly. The bad part is the carpeted floor that seem like they haven't been vacuumed. But overall its an okay place, just to get some sleep before going around SG. They have clean towels everyday."
