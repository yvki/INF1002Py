Suzanne P,Happy in Singapore,The rooftop pool was a gift; such a relaxing amenity. Babba Chews restaurant was a delight- great crew there and really good breakfast selections! Front desk staff also outstanding. We had a small problem that they bent over backwards to try to ameliorate. Would stay here again.,5
Perry G,Great Place. Good Hosting,"I had a great time with the accomodation. I loved the hospitality, assistance, and care throughout the stay. Special shotout to Aeron our “kabayan” who gave us good service and go-to tips on how to enjoy our time in SG! Highly recommended!!",5
Jacky W,"Friendly staff , great location and good breakfast","Stayed a week at Hotel Indigo in Katong and I must say it was a pleasant experience. Staffs were friendly, courteous and helpful. Room is clean with city view. Location is great with plenty of dining options. WIll certainly return to stay with them again.",5
Thomas Seow,Best of the best,"Would like to thanks all Front Office team and Baba Chew’s team for the effort and dedication on my 2 nights stay and my ROM lunch at Baba Chew’s. We were always at ease and we had lots of fun. The food and accommodations are worthy of recommendation as well. Once again, thank you!",5
Ronen_IL,Great place to stay in,"I had some medical issues while staying in the hotel. The amazing staff was very helpful, supportive and calmed me down during this stressful event. Other than that, the hotel is simple and nice, very clean, large rooms, with a team that helps with almost any (weird) question you may have. Many good restaurants in the area. You must try the laksa place right across the street (I’ve been told by several locals it’s one of the best)",5
Nadine O,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff,The hotel is really lovely and the rooms are so well designed. Absolutely well kept and clean. I love the small details like the notes they had placed to explain the choice of candies and other items. The staff are unbelievably welcoming and helpful with sincere and warm smiles as they greet you. We were fortunate enough to have been attended by Wilson who was exceptionally helpful with taking our photos (great photos btw!) as well as getting us a cab and being observant to his surroundings. Would definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends for being such a lovely and unique hotel with great customer service!,5
Nizam,Weekend Escape,This is definitely a gem in the East which I never expected. Lobby and rooms are clean and nicely decorated and love their fine details and furnishings as well. A def Gram worthy hotel! Of course the stay never complete with the amazing service by the team. The front office team which we interacted mostly from the start to the end are all friendly and make us feel welcome. I can’t remember everyone who we interacted but shoutout to Dervin for a a seamless check in and a note for checking on us if we need anything during our stay since we opt out to have housekeeping with our DnD sign on. Easy checkout with Jia Hui and Wilson as well. Of course the various staffs that constantly greet us whenever we walked past the counter at the lobby. Will definitely find time to return as,5
Naresh Kumar,Sept 2022 Solo Staycation,,5
Singap0reTraveller,Culinary Staycay,"Had a solo staycation for 2 days 1 night in King Standard Heritage View With Bath Room. What Can I Say? My staycation was AMAZING! Yes, though I stayed in 2017, but I decided to do another staycation in this hotel since I am doing staycations very actively since 2020 due to covid (unable to travel). Kind of got addicted to staycations. Back to review - Lovely hotel & room with very nice peranakan infused interior decor. Small details like the cupboard, cups and saucers, tiles are very heavily peranakan inspired. Great view of Katong from my room as well, thankfully I got to stay on one of the highest floors. Had dinner at Baba Chew's as well. Very delicious and the staff hospitality was great as well! Breakfast was good too! Infinity Pool was stunning!!! I should say this",4
sudguy c,Awesome stay at the Indigo Hotel,,5
yplj,Wonderful stay made by amazing hoteliers!,Did a staycay over the weekend at the hotel. It is conveniently located in the heritage area of Katong and perfect for exploring the wonderful cuisine around the area from hawker food to Peranakan and even old school Chinese restaurants. The room is nicely appointed with very nice heritage details. The roof top pool is very impressive. Service is top notch and super friendly.,5
Tim P,"Classic Peranakan Style, Modern Boutique Amenities","All I can say is wow! All of the staff made my stay fantastic. The front desk staff were extremely helpful several time during my stay. Too many to name Rosa, CK( the tallest man in Singapore) Tiffanie. The Breakfast at Baba Chews and the staff in there made me feel at home only with a lot more different things to try. Merry and Lucy were there daily to make sure my day started out perfect! The entire staff at Baba Chews were a delight to deal with. I managed to talk with the manager of Indigo and Baba Chews, Adel. This man has only one thing that drives him, your comfort. He takes great pride in his hotel and his staff and you can see it from the first moment you speak with him. No matter how busy, he will take the time to talk with everyone he can to ensure their stay is",5

Eddy C,A modern peranakan dreamscape,"This is my 3rd visit back to the hotel, with the previous visits being pre-covid. The property has always stood out for me, which was why I was so eager to revisit upon knowing of their reopening! Can I just say that the level of service far exceeded my expectations for a 4-star boutique hotel, and surpassed even the previous stays. What really blew me away was the friendliness and attentiveness of the hoteliers — making sure to look up and meet the guests’ eyes, smile and greet them (no matter whether they’re engaged with their desk duties or not). This was an observation made whenever I went in/out of the hotel lobby, and even if it may sound “trivial” to some — I think this speaks a lot about the brand culture and overall impression by Indigo/IHG. During our short stay, we",5
Li Sue,Birthday staycation,"This hotel is located squarely in the middle of my favorite part of Singapore - the Joo Chiat area of the East Coast. Literal walking distance to dozens of bars, restaurants and gyms (walking distance as in ""across the street"" not ""about a mile away""). The hotel staff is almost impossibly kind and pleasant. Rooms are decorated in traditional Peranakan style - my room had a large rain shower, two sinks, and ample closet space. The aesthetic is beautiful and a tribute to the history of the area. The roof pool and gym were easily accessible and provide a GORGEOUS view of the entire city. The included breakfast at Baba Chews was so delicious and with such a variety I would plan my day around it. Would absolutely recommend staying here if you're in Singapore. East Coast is great to",5
Ading A,Beautiful hotel with heritage touch!,"Fabulous 2 night stay at the Hotel Indigo Katong, an artful blend of old and new.  My room was surprisingly spacious (many a Singapore hotel room is tiny) with colourful local touches giving a heritage feel.  The black and white mural on the wall of my room depicting local hawker life inspired me to head out and explore the Joo Chiat area and local peranakan culture.  Breakfast at Baba Chews, housed in the old Joo Chiat Police Station had a great selection of western and local breakfast (can recommend the Nasi Lemak!), and the local area offers plenty of dining, bar and shopping options.  Great stay, staff super friendly and happy to help whatever time of day.  Rooftop pool offers great views over Singapore as well as a refreshing dip after all that exploring.  Bed comfy,",5
SAL,Super Hotel,"Hotel indigo is so friendly and it really is like a modern Peranakan dream! ~ 5 stars for everything especially the most wonderful staff. I’m glad you’re open and running, it felt quite emotional to be in Singapore again. Much love xxx",5
Dylan R,Lovely hotel,"Had a very pleasant and enjoyable stay at Hotel Indigo katong. The peranakan design of the room really impressed me alot, especially the bathroom. Prettiest design ever. Breakfast at Baba Chew was delicious with lots of choices of food to choose from. Will come back again as we felt really welcomed by all the staff from the front desk to the restaurant. Highly recommended. Special thanks to Miss Jess who delivered me my birthday cake to the room and showed us around the hotel. Thank you.",5
Jan M,My #1 Go-To in Singapore,"This hotel is nestled in Singapore Katong area, which is rich with peranakan culture and heritage buildings. The ambience is straight away drowned you to the peranakan era but with modern touch, some furnitures is heavy with heritage style and touch, the room is amazingly comfy and stylish, very colourful as well. Last but not least, baba chew restaurant is the one you should try as well!",4
bikemikeone,Just a wonderful place,"This was my first time at the Indigo Hotel, Katong and what a lovely place it is! My room was a 1 King Bed Standard Heritage View with bath, and it was just like on the website. The bed and linen were very comfortable, the room was spacious, the rooftop pool was just fabulous and all the staff were just wonderful. I had the breakfast included in my package and I was not disappointed. There was lots to chose from, western and eastern cooked food, cereal, fresh fruit and barista coffee, which was a fabulous as they had different milks to choose from. The staff there were very attentive and I'd like to give a special mention to Merry who was just lovely. I would defiantly go back.",5
Ruffedgerose,It was a nice hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights and it was a great experience. Pool area was clean and the themed rooms were a nice touch given the history of the area. Would recommend staying here. Bed was comfortable and air con was quiet.,5
andrea9881,Quaint Restaurant with Great Service,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the last several years and will be returning again this summer. There are numerous great hotels in Singapore - but this is always my #1 go-to. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated with up-to-date furnishings and bathrooms. I have had several different rooms, so I know this is true for all rooms. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable about the area. There is a great restaurant attached with a wide variety of good food and an ""included"" breakfast is available that cannot be beaten. The location is great as it is near two shopping areas as well as being located in the historic neighborhood of Katong. Best of all - it is sustainability friendly without affecting the customer's experience. This hotel also has a",5
KiwiExplorer,TRENDY AND QUIRKY VALUE FOR MONEY LUXURY,"Located in my favorite part of the city, Katongo/Joo Chiat, with so many good eateries, hotel Indigo is heaven. Room decor in local, Perenakan style, good bed and bathroom. Nice to be in the room. Breakfast no less than exceptional. Plenty of choice including lots of local touches. Service so friendly and helpful. The roofgarden with a large swimmingpool and the most awesome, stunning view of the entire Singapore island is so hard to leave behind. A most fantastic place to enjoy a swim, relax under the equator sun and see sunrises and sunsets over the orange tile roofs of Katongo and the island. Beautiful. Tasteful decor right throughout the hotel. Will be back.",5
Agus Emilyadi,Staycation Yahoooo!!!,"Very nice hotel to be in. It has a nice swimming pool and should look into making the room cooler, it looks a lil bit too vintagey. I love that there are games and all however can take into considerations other things.",5
Intrepidtraveler53,"Love, Love, Love","Our first and definitely not the last visit to Baba Chew’s. Attended a family wedding in a quaint Peranakan Restaurant Katong. It was just warmly set up and cosy. Service was top notch. The Manager, Anne and her team was very hospitable and service was on par with 5 star Hotel Restaurant. Well done Anne! We will be back with our friends.",5
Toothless,Tastefully Decorated Comfort with Great Service,"We stayed in this hotel for 1 night mid January en route from Myanmar back home to New Zealand. We picked what we thought looked like the nicest hotel closest to the Airport without having to venture into the downtown area. Both the hotel and the area were fabulous and much better than expected. The hotel is right next door to a big shopping Mall & immediately in front of the hotel are several restaurants. The hotels own restaurant Baba Chews is where we dined for Dinner and the atmosphere, service and food were excellent. Across the road is an immaculately restored block of shops and restaurants, the area is just gorgeous and we were disappointed we didn’t have time to explore. We stayed in a king bed deluxe room and it was fabulous. Tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and",5
EeMing,A wonderful one night anniversary stay,This hotel is very lovely and the decor is a heritage Peranakan. Upon check-in we are greeted with a very welcoming smile at the reception by Ms Nani and Mr Denry. As we checkin we have to fill up the health declaration form due to the Convid-19 outbreak. We got a complimentary upgrade as we are celebrating our Anniversary without even asking. Rooms are very clean spacious and have a very cute bathtub like what i said the decor is peranakan LOVE IT 💋. I truly recommend the people out there to tryout this place there is lot’s of local food around at this hotel and the beast among all best is the friendly staff at the counter never fail to smile and greet you even they are wearing a mask. Thanks Ms Nani and Denry,5
Rob L,Excellent stay,"The hotel is incredible. I had never stayed at an Indigo property, and I cannot wait to visit at another one. The decor is modern with traditional elements. The hotel has thought of every thoughtful touch. I don't want to ruin the surprises, but everywhere you look, there is an element of Peranakan culture or tradition from the foot wash tub to the candy treats. Ask the hotel to explain the room in full detail. The hotel is in the Katong area, which is near the airport. However, it's not in the central region of Singapore. Spend at least one night in Katong even if you want to stay in Central Singapore. The area is fantastic, and it's become a hipster-style neighborhood with incredible foodie destinations. The staff was helpful and gracious. The breakfast is yummy and",5
Ophir77,Peranakan-style comfort and hospitality,"The first impression was refreshing. You're greeted by a greenery wall and greenery around the property before entering. The main glass door of the lobby is not directly at the building entrance, giving it privacy and probably a nod to the traditional Peranakan house entrance, where it typically require a detour around a wall upon entering. The lobby was small and long but had Peranakan items around the area. There was the beautiful sets of rectangular carriers that resembled the Bakul Sia and had jars stacked up near the elevator. There were even side tables with Peranakan motifs at the front desk. What accompanied these beautiful decorations were the warmth and friendliness of the front desk staff. Check-in was smooth and the staff were helpful. They acceded to my request to",4
Punitha R,Amazing stay :),"I checked into Hotel Indigo Katong on 14th March 2020 to celebrate my 2nd anniversary with my partner. Upon arrival, due to the recent Covid19 Corona virus, we were asked to fill in a health declaration form before we are allowed to check in. Not long after checking in, there was a knock on our door and one of their staff actually delivered an anniversary cake to us which came to us as a surprise! We were staying in Room 1121, King Premier with Bathtub. The rooms were spacious, the toilet and showers were split into two different areas which was somewhat unique. There was a carrom table which allows us to have a game of carrom and the whole room was peranakan themed, exactly like how we see in the photos on their website. The bathtub faces the Katong neighbourhood and a sign",5
skippy-rates,Modern design led hotel,"My wife and I stayed here last year on a stop over from the UK to Australia. We came back this year for an 8 night stay. We were not disappointed. From the reception staff, to housekeeping, all very professional. Very happy and helpful. Nothing was too much. We had breakfast included and again the staff were great. The room was cleaned and presented well whilst we were at breakfast. It is located well for taxis and in future when the MRT station is finished. Will stay there again.",5
Angelica,HOUSEKEEPING!,"This was our fourth staycation at Hotel Indigo; the first in August 2017 followed by the second for Christmas in December of the same year. The third and fourth were also in August of 2018 and 2019 to watch the National Day Parade on a large screen while enjoying all the good food and kuih-kuih in the area. Obvious to say we absolutely love this ‘Peranakan’ themed hotel for the most part because we hail from Peranakan backgrounds and appreciate the thoughts, ideas, inspiration, knowledge and creativity that have gone into the development of this unique establishment, which has not only won our hearts over but has become our ‘home-away-from-home’. It was good to be met by familiar front office staff like Esther and Tuah (and Faris) who recognized my mother (this is important for",5
Ian D,Well Run Hotel Pleasant Part Of Town,"My sincere thanks for all the arrangements you've done for my stay and with all your little gesture it has been one of my memorable stay. Thank you so much for the complimentary room upgrade, late check out, and yummy pandan cake as well. All your staffs were super friendly and helpful. Please convey my hearfelt thanks as well. The rooms was very beautiful and I just loved it. Keep up your marvellous work team !!!",5
KenS,"Excellent stay, great service and charming room",We enjoyed our stay here which we chose on the basis of reviews on here; and also thought it would be fun to try a new less central location. Hotel is new. Rooms well kitted out; albeit with slightly odd configuration (split bathrooms) and slightly too much furniture in. Breakfasts good. Reasonable value.,5
leanne c,Faboulous roof top pool,"One of the reasons why we chose this hotel was the good reviews from the previous guest, we actually had a good staycation here . However, during our last day of our stay one of the housekeeping staff tried to enter our room when it's on a DO NOT DISTURB sign. This is totally unacceptable!!!! Guest privacy should be respected.",5
bus11traveller,Worth trying and must try their restaurant,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times most recently in December 2019. It is well located if you are happy not to be in the centre of Singapore in an interesting older style part of town. The staff on the front desk are always courteous and helpful. The rooms are very comfortable. The pool is good.The local choices to eat are great including Baba Chews which is linked to the hotel.,5
Joemisty,Spacious room well designed,"Probably one of the best stay I had in Singapore thus far. Extremely charming Peranakan themed-hotel, which my wife commended on the attention to details in the room. Get the king suite with a bathtub! The view is impeccable too. Semi-buffet & ala carte breakfast is done at the perankan restaurant next door. The food is fantastic, such as the traditional kaya toast set, the pancakes, Great location that is near many good cafes, eateries, bars and shopping. Even East Coast park is a stone's throw away Smart idea to have a discounted Sunday yoga for guests. Requested for a crib and it was provided. The crib is sturdy and clean.",5
197gabes,Great hotel for staycations,"We stayed at hotel indigo for 1 night with 4 children in an interconnecting room. The hotel has some great interior design with little features such as traditional sweets in jars. Both rooms were fairly small which is typical for Singapore but the facilities onsite and local arwa more than made up for this. Katong is a great area to visit and the hotel felt really central. There are plenty of great restaurants just outside of the hotel, which was helpful as the food at the onsite restaurant was quite poor and the choice at breakfast not great but adequate for 1 night. The rooftop pool and gym were fantastic. We would definately stay again.",5
SMJ0907,Beautiful hotel in great part of Singapore,"Food at the restaurant is amazing. Nice themed rooms, the food scrub is a nice touch, a selection of complimentary lozenges and candies. TWG tea bags! Close to airport but not too close, good selection of restaurants and bars nearby. On the downside, rooftop pool is a little overrated, a tad tiny and basically overlooking the neighbourhood, don’t expect any glam but more coziness. For this price, could actually be in a nice 4-4.5* closer in the city. Location wise, it really isn’t close to anything major and not connected to MRT so it’s either bus or taxis which some times are not the best options, especially when weather is bad, so bear that in mind.",4
chris2pherwong,Excellent Hotel with Beautiful Accents,"In a nice neighbourhood within walking distance to many eateries. Chilled casual vibes, room is spacious and look exactly like photo. Will recommend this to any guest looking for a different staycation compared to downtown hotel. Meals were good with good selection",5
Habeyah,One of the Best Hotels!,"First time staying an Indigo brand hotel. So did not really have much expectations when made a booking for staycation. Glad to say that the property did not disappoint and we had a good time. The check in was efficient and staff was friendly and gave the usual info on breakfast and check out timing before issuing the room key. Similarly, checking out was hassle free, the whole process took less than 5 minutes. The room like the rest of the hotel have a strong Peranakan influence which is nice as it blends well with the whole Katong area. There are several nice touches that made the stay specially memorable like offering free candy commonly found from one’s childhood, a table that also doubles as a carrom board which you can play on. The room we had also offered a great view",5
Adeline Potter,Peranakan chic with modern comforts,"We have really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Indigo. The rooms are unique and generous. The rooftop pool is exquisite. The hotel is a very easy 10 minute cab ride from Changi Airport. One star lost for a few reasons: - Baba Chews is the restaurant attached to the hotel where you can get buffet breakfast in the morning (was included for us) and meals at other times of the day. The service was just OK. Maybe it was because of Lunar New Year that it was so busy, but usually restaurants would staff up for such a peak period. The delays in being attended to on arrival and the wait for coffee was not acceptable. The breakfast food was pretty good, with the exception of the Nasi Lemak, but the evening meals were not so great. I had to send back the specialty crab soup which was cold. In",5
SumoTraveller,Excellent Inside and Out,"We love this hotel with its modern interiors mixed with Peranakan accents. It is highly Instagrammable and the rooftop pool is also very photogenic. Breakfast at the nearby restaurant was nice, service was efficient and our stay was very pleasant. The Katong neighbourhood is teeming with restaurants, bars and a supermarket is nearby. Love the East Coast neighbourhood vibe. Would love to return.",5
Keoweecruiser,Unusual hotel in quiet area,"Another hotel review from my recent trip to Southeast Asia, November 2019. This is the Indigo Hotel 🏨 in Katong, Singapore 🇸🇬 I have done a lot of traveling and stayed in many hotels throughout the years and the Indigo Hotel, Katong would have to be one of my favs! Unfortunately we only stayed here for a night as a 24hr layover before heading back to Toronto. Firstly, Katong is a beautiful area full of colors and a huge Peranakans culture still remaining. Received a warm and friendly welcome from the staff upon our arrival. We were provided a complimentary non alcoholic beverage during check in and to our pleasant surprise, was given a free room upgrade. I would highly recommend this hotel, and I will certainly be back the next time I visit Singapore 🇸🇬 again.",5
Han_yinu,Hip & Cool Boutique Hotel,"This place is truly remarkable in its interior design. It has brought Peranakan culture into the 21st century while staying true to the Peranakan heritage. Additionally, this has all the modern comforts of a hotel, including USB ports near the bed. The linen was clean and comfortable and the service is excellent. We would enjoy staying here again!",5
Dani c,hotel with lots of heritage,"Everything is made simple, yet nostalgically Singapore I loved the deco, the retro theme of early Singapore. The breakfast spread on local delicacies mixed well with the international fairs. Service was fantastic, all smiles and ready to assist .. Location might be a little further from town, but hey .. Singapore is a tiny city. So, everywhere is 20-40 mins away. Surrounding amenities are good, and lotsa of restaurants to choose from. Not forgetting that the beach is 15 mins walk away, but Singapore beaches are nothing to brag about",5
Clare,Excellent service and beautiful room,"We stayed two nights at the Hotel Indigo. The room clerks were friendly and accommodating. The room had personality - lots of color and homey, traditional touches. Full floor to ceiling windows allowed for a wonderful city view but couldn’t be seen from the bed. Large shower was nice, but is tiled and I would have liked a no-slip mat for the floor. Nice touches with Nespresso machine and candies in room. My husband enjoyed the foot bath after a long day of sightseeing. The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed sitting by the rooftop pool, although the water was pretty cold. This hotel is in a walkable area with lots of restaurants and shops. However the hotel is 15-20 minutes into the city by taxi or Grab (similar to Uber). There is no MRT in the area and we were told the",5
Winston Chuah,Excellent hotel with a Peranakan feel,"Unfortunately we only booked in for 3 days and 2 nights, on the stopover on the way through Asia. Other reviews have covered most of the Pro's, a few Cons below for the hotel to note For some reason, after we went up to our room after check in, it took ages (20 -30 mins) for reception staff to bring our bags up (we were going to bring them up ourselves but they insisted on bringing them up). No luggage racks, despite plenty of room for them in the room No towel rails to hang up bath towels, they had to be draped over the chairs to dry. Consider a free standing rack perhaps. Due to the lay out of the room (with the shower/handbasin/wash area taking up half the window view therefore the expansive street/neighbour hood view not made most of and cuts out light for the room.

anniemarr,Beautiful decor but noisy,"I was truly surprised by my stay at Hotel Indigo Katong. The rooms were of traditional peranakan design. The bathroom was great with quality products. What was more surprising was the wonderful front line staff. Young, polite and always with a smile. Very refreshing.... Breakfast was wonderful. Goof choice from and off the menu. The hotel is surrounded by many eateries. From local food to seafood, French, Italian, German and many more. You will never go hungry at Katong.",4

Leonard F,Nostalgia ! A Blast to the past into the good old 70's & 80's,"A uniquely designed hotel located in the Katong area about 7.4km from CBD, it's one of the best hotels I've stayed on my business travels. Part of the Intercontinental hotel group (IHG), you definitely can expect IHG's renowned hospitality and sure enough I wasn't disappointed. All staff go the extra mile to make your stay welcome and comfortable. I stayed at the Deluxe room and really liked the way the rooms are designed. A fusion of modern and vintage Peranakan. The working table is a converted carom table which is so cool! The wash basin is converted from an old sewing machine. Breakfast is a little special, they don't have a regulat breakfast buffet spread but have a menu where you can choose noodles, eggs, sausages, ham, etc. You do get bread and dessert biggest spread",5
Skaramoosh,Thumbs Up!,"This hotel is beautiful, quirky and different to most hotels which are often pretty much the same. The walls are just so thin, we could hear the people next door taking showers at 5.30 each morning as though they were in the same room. The loo might as well be doorless. It does let down the hotel. The breakfast is brilliant but evening meals not so good, particularly if vegetarian and gluten free. Staff are friendly, efficient and very helpful going the extra mile to assist. If the walls were sound proofed it would be five stars.",5
tracingtheworld,Hotel reflecting local Peranakan theme,"We stayed at the Indigo Hotel in Singapore for a short break in Singapore in the last week of December through January 1, 2020. In recent times, this is the best hotel we have stayed in. Highly recommend. Honestly - I cannot think of anything here that needs improvement. The rooms were beautiful, the service staff were exemplary and the bathrooms and shower were the best ever. Probably the best shower we have ever used :-) The rooftop swimming pool was surreal. The most unique rooms I have ever seen with Katong style interiors and architecture. Convenient coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The nicest, kindest service staff I have seen in a long time. Don’t hesitate - go ahead and book this place :-)",5
Awayteam72,Excellent Xmas Holiday Stay 2019,"I arrived at this property in their driveway and conveniently ended up in the wrong hotel. Poor signage. After a false start, I was in the right hotel lobby. The checkin was quick and easy especially if you're an IHG member. A free upgrade, free internet and much more. My room was a pleasant surprise and filled with nostalgia. A bit of Peranakan and a bit of the 80's and a dash of the 70's. The coffee table was a blast to the past which was a ""carom"" board turned table. The amenities in the room was also unique and reminded me of the 70's styled antiques and decorative. It was a very spacious room to begin with. The bed was very comfortable and the room had interesting wall finishing on the wallpaper. There was an antique cabinet which had all the room and coffee making",5
Amanda,"Great style, great neighborhood","Checking in was both pleasant and smooth. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Rooms were clean, comfortable and cool. Room amenities and toiletries were very good and more than adequate. Breakfast is at Baba Chew's, towards the main road. Good breakfast! Cleaning staff were very efficient and thorough. Location is in the East Coast....about 12-15 minutes from the airport. Unfortunately, it's not in the touristy/glitzy Orchard nor Marina area. Takes about another 12-15 minutes by cab to Orchard road or Chinatown. Lots of F & B outlets outside the hotel...around every corner and along the side streets. It's priced in the mid range category and it's well worth it. About a 10 minute walk towards the coastal highway there's a mall, Parkway Parade, and also a foodcourt",5
274indirap,Nice small hotel,"The twin room we booked was spacious with lovely touches of Peranakan motif. Prem at the reservation desk processed our checkin very quickly. He also recommended places for us to eat and helped us with the booking of a restaurant. He was very obliging when we requested him to change the time of the booking. It was very nice to return to the hotel and be greeted by him as if we were long term guests. The breakfast was a semi buffet plus a main dish from the menu - very sufficient to start the day with. The hotel is located in the center of Katong, very convenient for shopping and eating. The famous Katong laksa, Birds of Paradise and An Açai Affair are across the street.",5
Vy T,Comfortable stay in great location,"This is an excellent place to stay in Singapore. The decor and theme of the hotel are charming, tastefully capturing local historical Singaporean culture and feel, whilst offering all of the 21st century convenience you need. The staff were attentive and friendly, and the breakfast at Baba Chews was super. Room rates are very reasonable and the hotel is conveniently located with plenty to do just outside. We were very happy we chose Katong over Orchard Road this time. We look forward to returning.",5
Catherine M,"Hip but cosy, with great staff","I picked Hotel Indigo for its location in Katong, which I had not explored during my previous visit to Singapore and its unique design elements. Happy to say that in addition to those two things, the hotel offered a lot more - expeditious and incredibly friendly check-in, delicious breakfast each morning (where the lattes were excellent) in the connected restaurant, Baba Chews, and a beautiful rooftop pool area to boot. I particularly enjoyed the TWG tea and local sweets in the room, which were replenished throughout our stay. The design of the room was colorful but at the same time relaxing with its old-fashioned foot bath, cool mural, and geometric bathroom tiles. The room was an incredibly pleasant respite when we wanted to take a break mid-day from the heat. Thanks for",5
Bill,Comfortable room,"Small hotel in Katong. Nicely decorated with rooftop pool & gym. Attached restaurant has decent menu and bar. Breakfast offerings both local and western dishes. Gym is small but clean and functional. There is one row machine, 3-4 cardio treadmills & ellipticals, some free weights, one cable machine, one bosu ball and some yoga mats. Nice to see a container of antibacterial wipes and free bottles of water. A pity there are no nearby MRT stations, so we relied on GRAB rides.",4
Mirza,Wonderful staff of front office.,"Best aspect of my stay here was the room design and small Peranakan touches in the facilities. I was impressed with the concept of the hotel and the bathroom with ceiling to floor window and amazing view of Katong. The infinity pool is also amazing and great 24/7 gym. Location is great, extremely close to eateries and bus stop. However I believe that service could be further improved, felt more like an express check-in and check-out, not much genuine interactions from the staff.",5
Armand,Really like it,"This is a small gem, located in a kind of groovy part of Singapore. The decor references Singapore style - no chance that you feel you're in a generic ""hotel"" - while being very comfortable and functional. Like much of Singapore, there's an awareness of the planet's need to go green, and a great green wall marks the entrance to the hotel. There's an excellent ice cream shop just across the road, (Birds of Paradise), some great coffee (try Brawn & Brains), and some local designer clothing and accessories shops that are worth a visit. The hotel breakfast was OK, but seriously, you have a choice of excellent coffee and yummy food just outside your door so get adventurous! There's a roof top pool, perfect to cool off at the end of the day, and the yoga class on Sunday morning, next",5
jetters888,The interior decoration really represented the Katong district and culture,"My second stay here at the Hotel Indigo, Katong, Singapore. Good location, although not near MRT, plenty of bus services and taxis are reasonable. Very pleasant staff and comfortable room. Unlike a lot of hotels, the rooms feel like a home from home comfort. Rooftop gun and pool nice. Could maybe suggest a causal hotel bar in the area between hotel and restaurant, otherwise I'm not too keen in going to the restaurant just for a quiet drink. Restaurant, Baba Chews is great for breakfast. Friendly and efficient with good choices of cooked dishes and buffet items.",5
kakaobohne_dot,Wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!,It was an amazing time Here at the Indigo Hotel. It was super clean and comfortable. The staff of front office ahnna n firdaus was so nice and helpful the first second we stepped through the door. The room had a wonderful flair and so much love to the little details. Nearby are a lot of Shops and restaurant . We had a wonderful time here in singapore and especially here at the Indigo hotel.,5
JohnDunks56,Very nice hotel,"We are 2 adults and 1 toddler stayed 4 nights. Got a deluxe room with 2 beds facing the neighbourhood. Pro : 30m2 is quite big for singapore hotel Nice layout on the room Really quiet at night There's another door with card swipe after you arrived on your room's floor for more safety Neighbourhood is superb! There are lots of restaurants and shops with peranakan style A mall next door has a clinic and kids playground Recommend to use grab all the time with 15 minutes to vivo 15 minutes to airport 15 minutes to marina bay Con : Not much places to hang clothes Hot water sometimes need a couple of minutes Overall, really like it and definitely a must try if you are bored with orchard. You can explore katong and see a different singapore",5
Riki,Great accommodations and terrific service! Highly recommended!,"We liked Indigo Katong Hotel. In addition to the superb service, the details in the room really represented the Katong district, heritage and culture from the pillows, the chairs, rabbit candies down to the red slippers. Kudos to the friendly, helpful and attentive staff of Prem, Nari, and Tiffafy. The hotel is located on a major street and a short walking distance (across the street) to many restaurants, cafes and food stalls offering some delicious local dishes, shopping centers, and a grocery store. It was a very enjoyable stay.",5
Paul B,Nice little corner of Katong,It was an amazing time Here at the Indigo Hotel. It was super clean and comfortable. The staff was so nice and helpful the first second we stepped through the door. Breakfast was sooo delicious and the staff there was so nice and sweet! The Infinity Pool in top ist just amazing!( especially at the evening ). The room had a wonderful flair and so much love to the little details. Nearby are a lot of Shops and restaurants. And the busstation ist just around the corner. We had a wonderful time here in singapore and especially here at the Indigo hotel!!,5
stefanie,A short & unique stay at Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,"The room was spacious and extremely clean, the staff helpful and friendly, the roof top pool was great with views. Loved the additional touches in the room especially the foot bath and salts comfort bed",5
Grant N,Perfect stopover experience,"Great accommodations and terrific service! Highly recommended! Beautiful, clean, great staff, nice location, also have very good meeting rooms and WiFi, nice breakfast, good mall close by. Will be happy to return",5
Tara,Hotel Indigo,What a nice discovery and a pleasant change from the bustle of diwntown...you are not far away...15 mins by bus and convenient to airport.20 mins bus or cab.. Rooms were quiet and divine.Peranakan style is pleasing to the eye.The self foot bath is amazing and very needed at end of a long walking day.the amenities provided were great Biological from Australia. The roof top pool and gymn were fabulous and what a view over Katong and the stadium etc....baba chews in the old police station down below is a real find and highly recommend it for both dinner and breakfast...lovely use of buffet pantry in the morning and lovely tapas style cooked eggs and sweet offerings along with all the staples reminded me of the Best of W Resorts breakfasts!!! The fusion Peranakan style,4
Kasirha G,A great stay at my favorite hotel in Singapore,"We booked a 1-day stay (Thursday - Friday), I am quite impressed and satisfied with their service. The check-in and check-out process was very smooth and fuss free. Our room was facing Holiday Inn Express so we kept the curtains closed most of the time. We love the unique room design, their ""coffee table"" is actually carom table (with actual carom game), the bottom of the bathroom vanity table has a manually operated sewing machine design. The thoughts put in for the small details in the room is very interesting. Especially when it was quite familiar to all of us. It was easy for us to get food as there are a whole stretch of dining places across the streets. Varies from our local Katong Laksa, to Indian food, Korean BBQ, bars, and dessert shops etc. Overall we're very pleased",5
pankaj b,Worth a stay,"Stayed 3 nights on our way to Europe and 1 night on our return. Rooms were the best appointed of all our travels - from the complete quiet (bar the very occasional muffled voice in the corridor), tasteful decor, views over Katong, a great 'cupboard of joy' (complimentary and pay for bar fridge etc), comfy beds, iron, aircon, a decent sized safe big enough for an iBook, with a separate toilet and shower featuring a view for something different! Staff couldn't not have been more professional, friendly and helpful, the infinity pool at night was very special, as was the included breakfast - best of our trip, unlimited, including an extensive buffet, to-order cooked dishes, and a changing side menu of Asian inspired dishes every morning. Not walking close to the fabulous rail",5
Janine B,Airport delay stop over,"Absolutely loved this hotel I stayed here for 10 days and it was just 100%! Staff at reception were amazing all the time welcoming you back wishing you a good day when you went out or just saying hello. The little extra room touches were something I’ve not had before, the little foot spa, the complimentary sweets and pressed coffee. Also the decor was lovely the picture on the wall of the local areas and the size of the rooms is fantastic. I loved the fact the shower was on the opposite side of the room to the toilet. This was my first time at Indigo and if I head back to Singapore I won’t be staying anywhere else. The swimming pool was amazing and the gym was well equipped but it’s best to walk down to east coast park and enjoy the outdoor running or cycling.",5
bari_ttc,truely amazing,"I have stayed at this hotel at least ten times over the past three years. The service is always friendly and helpful (and I’m always glad to see some familiar faces). The location is very convenient, with plenty of restaurants within walking distance and two close bus stops that can take you straight into the city. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants a cozy hotel with local flair and easy access to the rest of Singapore.",5
NaniNani,Best bday celebration,The rooms have been designed in a slightly different way which gives a goo feeling when you are in the room. Toilet is situated besides the entry door (as is the place for washroom normally). But bath area & vanity counter are at the other end of the room. Interiors are beautiful & effort has been put in to decorate it. Breakfast options are limited for veggie's and something they can improve on.,5
Karys M,One of the best hotels ever,"Made a last minute booking at Hotel Indigo after having my flight delayed. About a $15 taxi fare from the airport. Hotel was conveniently located, and the room was well appointed. Hotel staff very welcoming and were able to accomodate a later check out which was much appreciated. Heaps of restaurant options around hotel.",5
Kay H,Unique - definitely worth it,"A short taxi ride from airport, we had warm welcome from the front desk. The room is unique Nyonya style design, you can't find anywhere in the world! The swimming pool is the highlight, day and night have totally different view. Will definitely stay here again next time!",5
Sadie N,Stylish base to explore Singapore,Beautiful hotel Beautiful staffs and friendly Nice neighbourhood! Will definitely recommend to others. I like best is the pool and view. Cld catch nice sunset photos. Nice warm friendly staffs always smiling.,5
NorthMonkeye,Great hotel in good location,"I had an exceptional experience at Hotel Indigo. From the moment we checked in, everything was perfect. The customer service was a dream come true. The room was gorgeous, with amazing views. Every part of the design was well-thought out from the foot bath to the complimentary retro candy. The bed was comfortable and the toiletries smelt wonderful. The pool and breakfast were two highlights! I can’t thank Hotel Indigo enough for their service (especially lobby host Jiahui who was particularly lovely) and I would actively encourage other people to stay here!",5
Westbury Wanderer,Stylish Hotel,"Simply fabulous, quirky, clean, helpful staff, amazing pool area, great location - I really have nothing bad to say. Excellent base to explore Singapore lots of great food outlets around for lunch or dinner. Breakfast options away from the hotel are limited but I think that is more that Singaporean’s don’t rise too early. There is a little Indian diner a few blocks walk which is open 24 hours very authentic but we had omelet and coffee two mornings in a row for $6.50 for two of us - great value. Would recommend as a great spot half way between airport and city 10 out of 10😀",4
Tosugaradream,Fabulous and quirky,"We loved the style of this hotel. The first thing you notice in the room is the mural on the wall and the colourful tiles in the bathroom. The second thing is the little touches: the Singaporean sweets, the tea and coffee, the foot bath and the toiletries box in the bathroom. All of this things are not at the expense of the basics: the bed was large and comfortable, the shower was spacious and had plenty of hot water, and there was a separate sitting area. The breakfast at Baba Chews was included in the nightly rate and offered a great range in the buffet selection: fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cheese, meats, different juices, etc. This was in addition to unlimited choices from a hot breakfast menu that had changing daily specials. This set us up nicely for a day of exploring.",5
JMtravelling2013,"Highly recommended: lovely space, efficient, fun location","Based a “out of town” on the east coast between the city and airport. However road system is so good it’s only 10 minutes by taxi ($15 on ‘Grab’ app) to Marina Bay in the centre so worth being further out to save massively on cost. Bit of a walk (20mins to MRT). Good pool on the roof. Rooms clean, new and modern with a nice local decorative twist. Close to good eating spots such as Din Tai Fung. Would stay here again.",5
Lynda M,Superb,"We enjoyed our short stay here. Our room was beautifully decorated and had a great view over the main street. It was a pleasure to stay in a room with character. There was an interesting choice for breakfast, as well as the usual fare. The roof top pool was super, either for a serious swim, or, to watch the world below go by. There were plenty of places to explore within walking distance including the coast, shopping malls and plenty of good restaurants. It was relatively easy to catch a bus into the centre of town and explore.",5
Sajed C,"Location, culture, service","We loved this hotel. The decor was quirky without being ridiculously out there. The little touches of Singapore lollies (love the white rabbit ones) free water bottles at check in and the “Good Morning” foot soak bowl and goodies was fantastic. We were made to feel extremely welcome and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The staff were very friendly, professional and personable. The pool area was great with a fabulous view. It’s in a great area with lots of restaurants and beauty parlours close by and buses are very handy to catch into town. A quick taxi ride into the airport only cost us $15 which was a lot less than the $45 taxi2airport from on line cost us. If I had to find a negative it would be that there was no bath as I love a bath..would highly recommend",5
FelizBlue,A nice hotel to stay...,"I visited Singapore for a holiday with friends and loved staying at Hotel Indigo. The rooms are excellent - filled with lovely touches drawing on the history of the area as well as making for a comfortable stay. Highlights included the open, well designed bathrooms which made the room feel huge, TWG tea, sweets, foot soak accessories, comfortable bed, good AC. The rooftop pool and gym were great. The location is fun for visitors, we enjoyed walking down Joo Chiat Rd to look at shops and the old buildings, including the colourful Peranakan houses. There are so many options for breakfast around and other eating and drinking, including a supermarket. We travelled by bus into town, which were frequent and took 25-40 mins depending on location. Very highly recommended.",5
Colin G,Great stay at funky boutique hotel,"Great location away from the bustling city, but a short bus ride $2 into centre. The staff were so friendly, helpful and efficient. We loved the decor in the room and hotel lobby which was also extremly clean. The infinity pool was never crowded, in fact we mostly had it to ourselves. The hotel is situated in a conservation area and many restaurants are on your doorstep.",5
Jolaw343,Excellent Atmosphere and friendly staff,"This is my hotel of choice when visiting my former residence on Singapore. Away from the touristy Orchard district, this clean and well kept gem in the Katong district offers proximity to dining, shopping, the airport and arguably the best laksa in the city. The breakfast options are quaint and the room design and decor are peranakan themed. Coupled with great service, a rooftop pool, well equipped fitness center and reasonable prices, it’s hard to choose a different go-to hotel.",5
558ronitm,Fancy hotel with rooftop view,Has been here with my friend just few days before. I love the design of the hotel room - Bohemian style mixed with antiqued Staffs : Very nice and always smile Facilities: Have gym and swimming Location: Nearby Katong 112 and close to many restaurant. For example: 328 Katong Laksa / Chicken Rice / All day breakfast etc... Transportation: Grab /Taxi will be good (for my own opinion),5
LuM,A boutique hotel in a upcoming area of Singapore,"Really enjoyed a one night stay at hotel indigo and wish it had been longer. Funky boutique style with great design and rooms. Rooftop pool had amazing views and the gym was a bonus! The local Katong area was worth a spending some time on too! However, the staff were amazing with Nani at the front desk worth a special mention. She was the perfect example of what 5 star service should be! In fact all the staff at the hotel provided good service. We look forward to staying again!",5
Tim K,Better than the average...,"Keeping up the Indigo tradition of quirky motels in local communities, this has to be my most favourite one yet. Located on a street filled with small shops and a huge range of dining experiences we were never left hungry. The rooms are a delight to stay in and the pool is a lovely retreat from the afternoon sun. If you are looking for somewhere a bit different but still luxurious, this is the place to stay.",4
Barry G,Flawless,"It is a business hotel with a twist of Singaporean texture. The staff behaves very nicely and professionally. It does not give any homely feeling but they are courteous and helpful. I went in for the pool and I loved it. The rooms are fine as Singapore is space stricken, don't expect big rooms, they are better than other hotels. You have a lot of Indian restaurants around and an amazing ice cream parlour just across the street. I would visit again.",5
dordor-Sin,Lovely upmarket boutique hotel,"Hotel Indigo. A brand name that prides itself on taking on the influences of the local area. And in this case, the Katong area of Singapore. Although the charm of the area is slowly making way for modernization, the hotel's rooms are accentuated with decor that brings nostalgia back to the local staycationer. To the overseas tourist, a brief insight to the simpler days of old Singapore. Room itself could not be faulted. Excellent shower and amenities, the toilet design was interesting, keeping the shower area and the toilet area separate (think opposite ends of the room). Bed was comfortable, minibar area was interesting. Carrom board for a coffee table? Genius. Gym on the rooftop was well equipped and well stocked. Swimming pool has expansive views over Katong and",5
Dilip dodhiwala,Nice stay,"My recent stay at Hotel Indigo was probably the best I've had so far in Singapore. The room I stayed in was quiet and comfortable. Service was friendly and professional, from reception staff through to those attending to the room. I particularly liked the themed interiors which provide a unique insight to the surrounding Katong region - a little design flair which links the hotel to the streetscape. There's no 'work space' for the business traveler, however the low table provided in the room was suitable for short duration. I wouldn't want to be working there for long periods. I would book this hotel again.",5
Stjepan B,Excellent service,"Having just spent my birthday in this fabulous Hotel, I can only say what an absolute pleasure it was to stay there. The staff are great, the decor is stunning, the room (1115) was brilliant, it was just perfect for what I wanted. It was only a $15 cab ride from T2 at Changi, and there is heaps of great eateries on the main street if you want to sample worldwide foods. The Hawkers about 250m from the Indigo in an easterly direction was just brilliant if you want to try street food. The rooftop infinity pool is a highly recommended place to relax and enjoy the stunning views. Only one minor fault with my room, there is no towel rails to hang the towel up after your shower, but other than that, it really is a wonderful Hotel to stay in. The MRT is a short bus ride and get on the",5
astonm999,"Best choice you can do, apart some noises.",It's a gem in this Katong area. Hotel is not big but connected with Holiday Inn Express Katong. Hotel has a family or home feel especially its Peranankan theme in entire hotel from lobby to cafe to rooms. Only didnt really like the cafe as it's small and tight on space but food and service both outstanding. Hotel room is unique and will bring back different memories.,5
mmbana,Beautiful Rooms and Great Staff,I stayed with my daughter in this hotel recently.city view rooms on higher floors are very nice.they are spacious with nice decor.management has eye on every detail to ensure comforts of the guests.rooms are equipped with sofa and king size bed with comfortable mattresses.it has wardrobe and fridge also they provide tea coffee making kettle and even umbrella to protect guests from sudden rain. Breakfast was very nice with vegan options for benifit of vegetarian guests. Infinity swimming pooland gym on 16th floor is very nice. Hotel is situated near airport and easily accessible to tourist attractions by bus or taxi.east coast beach is oeaceful nice and very near to hotel. and park parade mall offers offer quality shopping expierence.I recommend this hotel for peaceful stay,5
Yun Z,Great value and experience,"We stayed for 5 nights. I don't have any complaint. Service were excellent, rooms very clean. Rooftop swimming pool was amaizing. Swimming pool was never to busy, some nights I was on my own in the pool. Enjoyed all 5 days there and will be back for sure. Staff were very helpful, excellent customer service.",5
rqf61,Our favourite Singapore hotel,"My husband an myself spent 6 nights, and we cannot imagine better choice. Location of hotel is perfect, rooms are big, very nice, and make you feel at home, maybe better. Staff is pro and able to satisfy requests in case of need. Breakfast is generous, good quality, a pleasure! Roofpool, is magic! Few tips, for perfection, improve room setup, looks like the check list is not always used, once bathrobes were missing, same for foot care wipes. Both fixed very quickly. Last point is some noises, but the responsibility of this is to be assigned to architects and builders that apparently did not use appropriate isolating materials. So you can listen voices from other rooms, and shower/toilet water of other rooms. Apart this, fantastic. Thanks.",5
DavidWorldTravel,Good choice off the beaten path,"Stay for 1 night on a stopover and what a beautiful hotel room, the attention to detail was lovely. The foot bath with soaking salts was lovely after a long flight, the room was spacious with gorgeous decor and lovely view (12th floor). In a good location, close to Changi and lots of restaurants within walking distance. The staff were very friendly and it was a good breakfast.",5
snaem85,Lovely Peranakan Concept Hotel,This hotel is located in a busy and trendy neighborhood near the east coast park. All staffs are friendly and helpful. Our room has awesome view and is decorated nicely with peranakan style. The infinity pool has great view of the city and is perfect to view sunset and sunrise. Breakfast has a good selection of variety and worth the money. There are many great restaurants and boutique shops nearby. Will stay here again next time.,4
At09,Nice hotel great place to visit,"Our stay: we stayed in a King Bed Premier View Room With Bath for 2 nights. The area: the hotel is relatively close to Changi (SGD15 taxi), in an interesting local area. It's a 15 minute walk to the beachside path, which has a very long walking/jogging path next to the shore. Plenty of great restaurants nearby. Pluses: great rooftop pool - warm, with lovely views; the rooms are a good size, nice views and colourfully and interestingly furnished; very comfortable bed; very friendly and efficient staff; all in all a great, relaxing stay outside the usual tourist areas. Minuses: very little really; most importantly, the hotel is not near the MRT, which means that you need to catch a bus (easy and close) or get a taxi to get to the usual tourist areas or to get to an MRT station;",5
Tida T,Perfect stay for first time at Hotel Indigo brand.,"Katong is one of those quarters of Singapore where you still sense some of the charm of the old city that has been lost to the glitzy chic of the center and those other parts that tourists get to see. It boast great restaurants and the Indigo Hotel is right in the middle of it. It has a stunning rooftop area where you can work out in a well equipped gym and have a decent swim in a nice infinity pool, only drawback being that it does not offer that great views. What really got us hooked is the outstanding breakfast that is being offered by the associated restaurant.",5
CristinaSamsudean,Best Hotel in Singapore,"We did a day staycation at the hotel. Loved the concept of the hotel. Loved the infinity pool even more. Bed was comfortable. Free WIFI and free parking. The breakfast menu is limited, but he food that we ordered was really good. Check-in and check-out were fast. Staffs were efficient, friendly and helpful. Would definitely consider coming here again.",5
emp e,"Comfortable room, excellent staff, great breakfast",The room is very spacious . The view from the rooftop Swimming pool is great. They have a 24 hrs gym. You can wash ur feet using the basin provided in the room . One downside of the hotel is the toilet and bathroom have no locks,5
poyosann,Fantastic stay near to a lot of restaurants and cafes! Best breakfast!,"I have made the right choice for taking staycation here on my birthday. To be honest, not easy to come to the hotel if you are taking public transportation as this is can reach by bus only. But location is good for Katong area which you can enjoy walking around Peranakan culture area and eat all good food. We were greeted by CK, he is very informative and helpful. A room with a neighborhood view on high floor given which was awesome. We really enjoyed taking pictures in the room and this decoration has many things to play around. Warning! Always shut off the curtain while you are in the bathroom since people can see you exactly from the ground LOL. We really enjoy the pool area. At first, you may think that it looks small, but it’s actually appropriate size. You can do outdoor",5
Keith,Different and very good. .,"We stayed at indigo Hotel the last 2 nights of our honeymoon. It was by far the best hotel yet. Very nice decoration, a good infinity pool, super friendly and helpful staff.... smells incredibly good, the sheets are very soft and clean, great views from the shower :) As an environmental preoccupied person, I found that the hotel has a green policy and you can earn points if you choose not to make up your room every day. For that you only need to hang the green sign on the outside of your door. I found out late about this policy but I feel everyone should know about this option from the first day. I confidently recommend indigo Hotel.",5
Phoebe Line,Beautiful hotel in Katong.,"This was our second visit to the hotel, ten months on. The quality of the service, which was already very good, has only improved further. The breakfast was, yet again, excellent. The room was very clean, and the beds comfortable. There are some fine views across the city both from the rooms and from the swimming pool at the top of the building.",5
Magnus L,Unique hotel,"Room was dope, lovely views with the bathtub. One thing I don’t like about the room is the shared door and I could hear other hotel guest talking in another room and when they fill thier bathtub with water we can hear it too totally no privacy at all lucky we have quiet neighbours at night! Breakfast was ala Carte and they is also small breakfast bar. Staff were all friendly helpful and welcoming Located to lots of cafes and restaurants ! There are 2 shopping mall ard that u can check out. Rooftop pool I enjoyed the most becos most of the time is empty! And the views is good for a good photo of Katong Highly recommend!",5
Domenico S,Amazing stay,"Here for a weekend staycation . I know this is a boutique hotel with unique deco, but stepping into the room for the first time is a big wow . It’s beautifully decorated in the peranakan style, spacious, new and just different . You usually expect to know where the bed is, where to locate the table, the washroom etc . Here i need a while to orientate myself. We were placed at the 15th floor, so a high floor with good view. The service is very good, warm and welcoming . The location is right smack in Katong area. I have tried other hotels in the vicinity so i know I’m not going to be disappointed by the location and the food options here. Walking distance to east coast park for a morning run too . The only hiccup here is when we tried to request the delivery of a special amenity",5
Warner D,"Wow! this is a great hotel, and surprising.","The swimming pool is very good and Beautiful. We also have the 15% off discount for the BABACHEWS, the restaurant next to the hotel and open to 00:00. It is convenient in Katong to go sightseeing. We recommend Indigo.",4
Deano1984newman,Honeymoon 1 night stop over,This hotel is one of the most unique hotel I've ever been too. Fabulous rooms with a swimming pool that is excellent for kids and a gym that is fairly big. The area is also close to the shopping mall and other smaller shops which is very convenient.,5
Jarrod H,Great hotel,This Hotel was just amazing!! Everything was so great! Singapore is an amazing city and I definitely recommend this Hotel which is close to the airport and to the major sights of the city! Breakfast was absolutely delicious! The pool so nice and clean as well as the indoor gym!! It's also good value for money compare the lovely stay we had.,5
savi_brown,Clean & Nice,"Katong is not exactly walking distance from Orchard Road( nothing is walking distance from anywhere in Singapore) but taxis are affordable and I was told that the Hotel Indigo will be close to a new subway station opening soon, which means that distance doesn’t matter with the great public transport system in Singapore. This is important, or actually unimportant which is what I am trying to say when it comes to the Hotel Indigo. Located in Katong with its wide streets and low-rise development, much of it renovated shophouses from colonial times, the hotel benefits from the clean and relaxed open atmosphere, which it shares. This is a new hotel refreshingly decorated in the public areas, and with very original layouts in the rooms. Unfortunately, we only stayed one night",5
Mwu504,love this hotel!,My wife and I stopped here for one night before Bali and couldn’t fault the place very clean and tidy stunning room with huge bath and great roof pool. Good location for main city. Would defiantly stay here again,5
DadsCanHaveFunToo,A boutique hotel in a trendy area - great for couples,My wife and I stayed here twice. Really great hotel. The effort to try to connect the aesthetic with the local community is a very nice touch. Very comfortable accommodations. Good size room. Comfortable beds. Staff is really helpful. Cannot recommend highly enough. I know we will stay there again when we come through Singapore next time.,5
DieRM,"Stylish design, superb service, nice facilities",We were there during our Singapore visit. Hotel is located between two bus station where you can go to the tourist hot-spots very easy. Amazing hotel with clean room and nice breakfast. You can have European or Location breakfast if you want. And last but not least the amazing pool at the rooftop with an amazing view of the skyline of Singapore.,5
Eat Pray Love,Wonderful Staycation,"I have stayed in this hotel for quite a few times and it has never disappointed me. The hotel is very stylish, I love how they mix Nyonya element into the interior. The hotel and the rooms are always clean and the bed is very comfortable. The staff are very efficient whenever I requested for something they sent up within few minutes. Location wise, maybe it's not very close to MRT station however Grab is my option most of time anyway. And there is a shopping centre just right next to the hotel and many nice local restaurants around this area so no need to worry where to find food. I recommended those who hasn't visited this hotel or thinking to visit Singapore must come stay in this hotel.",5
Magdalene T,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel sits next to a Holiday Inn Express and the two entrances are very close together; as we discovered when we arrived at the wrong hotel, looking a bit shocked. Once we'd relocated ourselves to the correct entrance we immediately knew we were in the better of the two options. The Peramakan style as you first walk in is evident throughout; rich in colour, shapes, and expressive design, this boutique hotel is best suited for those who seek something a little bit different. The rooms are equally colourful and give you that WOW! factor as you walk in. Our room had a huge mural on the wall of a local scene as well as dark wooden floors and furniture, ornate tiling and a wicker chair in the bathroom area. The toilet had its own separate area, which was a great idea. It",5
Nadya,Favorite of all,"I like the indigo hotels because of their design but also because they care for details. The Indigo SIngapore Katong is no exception. The rooms are well kept and stylish, the staff tries to make everything possible they can to make the customer happy. They not only ask if everything was alright but also if there is anything they can make better - which I do not experience often in hotels. Also small details are taking care of, for example there is good coffee in the room (French press, not this instant coffee you often get with the american chain hotels). The pool is really nice - you can have a proper swim there - it is definitely long enough for a good workout. Katong / the area itself is very nice. There are lots of nice restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk. The",5

Jyy,"Great stay, great place",My girlfriends booked this place for my hen's night celebration. Gorgeous hotel with fantastic room amenities. Bathroom and toilet were clean and toiletries given were lovely. We booked the Premier room and I love the availability of the Nespresso machine. Presence of the Hudson's and white rabbit sweets were so nostalgic. The Good Morning towel and the Cha Kiak ( wooden clogs ) were such cool add ons. I was so impressed by the room's decor that I booked a room for my wedding just so I can take gorgeous pictures as their theme matches my theme ( Peranakan! ). You're such a gem of a find in the East!,5

And - the - best - of - the - best - the bathroom with the view of the city 💯 Not forgetting the hotel restaurant that we had breakfast, Baba Chew, its Perakanan ambience was on point from the interior to the menu.And the service was excellent.

Jo_1010,Unique!,"First I’d like to say this hotel was beautiful. The staff were extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Our room was gorgeous and clean and no attention to detail had been missed. The rooftop pool was a perfect spot to relax after a long day exploring Singapore. With that said we spent a majority of our money there paying for taxis. There is no subway nearby yet and so in order to get to Marina Bay, Chinatown and most hawkers a taxi is the only way to do it. Although Katong the neighborhood is a really neat spot to walk around and has plenty of great restaurants I wish the hotel could have been in a more walkable area.",5
richp1200,Fantastic,"Great service and great stay! Very hospitable and helpful staffs. Amenities were great too. Will recommend this for family, friends and even solo. Loved the view from the pool and gym was really great. A pity that I didn't get to eat at baba hew but heard great stuffs about their cocktails",5
Bo Q,A hotel truely has local style,Staff were friendly and helpful. The room is pleasant to stay. It is quite spacious and complete with Peranakan decorations which makes the room stand out. The wall decals are very nice depicting part of lives in Singapore. Another plus point is eateries are aplenty around the vicinity of the hotel. Will definitely be back for more stays. This hotel comes highly recommended.,5

StefanZaharinov,Different Experience in Singapore,"I have never visited Singapore before and this hotel was booked for me and I am so glad it was. The hotel staff are amazing so friendly and helpful , always welcoming with a smile and a greeting. The staff in the morning at breakfast always made a great start to my day there is a great choice of food to choose from . My room on floor 14 had a great view over Katong the decoration was a blend of old with modern touches very comfortable bed Very roomy shower just remember to close the curtain 😀 My room was cleaned every day I did opt not to have the bedding changed every day A good choice of complimentary tea and coffee . Roof top pool area is a great place to watch the sun set and the pool looked very inviting even thought I didn’t use it as always back late I had a",5
A&J,Honeymoon,"Stayed at Indigo Katong 2018 Oct. It was amazing. The location is not near a traditional famous area of Singapore. But, the neighborhood is quite nice with quite a lot dinning options. Hotel staff is really helpful. They help me to adjust the room rate from my cooperate 1 person stay rate to 2 adults and 1 child rate. The price is quite reasonable. We flew in on a midnight flight and arrived at hotel lobby at 8am. Folks in lobby is very helpful to complete all check-in process and help us take care of luggage before we can check-in the room at night. Hotel decoration has very genuine local style. The layout is quite specially but acceptable. Room is not large but enough. Quite many nice stuff displayed in the closet. They gave local sweeties for free, which is really a plus. We",5
scottypwilliams,A really excellent hotel,"We have stayed at the Indigo Hotel over six times and every times we leave having a positive experience. The rooms are big, clean, beds comfortable, lots of pillows, cool shower, friendly staff, fun pool/roof top deck, great location to lots of restaurants and shopping.",5
HammieHam,Wonderful Baba stay,"During my time in Singapore, I wanted to escape from the typical touristic places where everyone goes, and I get to stay and one really different place, namely, Hotel Indigo in Katong area. It used to be the site of the former Joo Chiat Police Station and inspired by the Peranakan culture, which is very unique and interesting for me. One of the perks of this hotel was definitely their roof-top pool, which gives you an outstanding view over the area. When it comes to the food, it is out of this world, so delicious and tasty. Seriously guys, if you are looking for something different, give it a try, this place has so much to offer. And of course, you can get some amazing pictures in this area as well.",4
KingsLCL,I was Embraced by a Heavy Coat of Nostalgia,"Great time in our first destination for our honeymoon. Hotel Indigo have a glamorous bedrooms, with a very traditional and funky decoration. The team there is fantastic and very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend. Hope to come back in some point. Thank you.",5
GraceNewYorkState,Loved the hotel.,"We loved our stay here so much. It’s a fantastic boutique style hotel. The staff were very helpful in all ways, an told us about the local area. The room itself was really nicely designed, and very stylish. It was a good size with comfortable seating and great bathroom/shower area. The bed was comfy and we slept well on each of the 3 nights we were here. Rooftop pool is a massive bonus, offering great views across the city. It’s about 15/20 mins from the airport, very quiet but in a great area with lots of bars/restaurants close by. We walked over to the beach/park on the coast in no time at all. Bus stops nearby, only downside is that it’s about 12min walk to a metro, didn’t bother us at all because the area is so nice. We will definitely stay here again when we visit",5
Brit-living-in-NZ,Outstanding,"Room was tastefully designed, Peranakan style. Plush bed and a decent sized toilet. Hotel was very nice to even provide a complimentary cake whilst we were celebrating an anniversary there. Location is good considering the number of eateries around the Katong area. Close proximity to airport as well.",5
Wayne M,fantastic,"This is the first time I am staying in IHG’s Indigo chain of hotels. I know now why all my friends were giving me the you-are-gonna-to-be-impressed + wow look. It was like stepping into some kind of hybrid lavish hotel museum when I arrived into the lobby. And after I checked in, the feeling of just walking into another hotel room did not transpired. Instead, I thought I walked into a love making movie set made for the Peranakan 60s in Singapore. They make you step back in time, the décor and the details. I was immediately embraced by a heavy coat of nostalgia. That red wooden Chinese clogs placed by the door, that same rustic red metal toilet pan I used to have under my childhood bed, I paused and stood still. I let memories of old played like faded flashcards through my mind.",5
Jonathan G,Brilliant,"A few minutes away by taxi from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Katong is a community unto its own. Historic sites and temples, shopping, restaurants and a short walk to the coast/beach. Hotel staff was wonderful and rooms were fantastic as well. Great roof top pool and fitness room. Enjoyed the breakfast options. Highly recommend.",5
ooompah,Lovely hotel - location a bit disappointing,"This is the best hotel ever, and the best hotel chain too! Stunning decor, amazing service, beautiful room.

I love all the touches in the room - eg/ a foot bath and associated products.",5
xiaozhensu0013,Nice and Cozy Stay,"We stayed in this part of Singapore for the first time and were not disappointed. The Hotel Indigo offers a great venue, great rooms, location and staff. This will be our new place to stay in Singapore - you will enjoy staying here and the rooftop pool is great.",5
ATSSR,"Great Place, but service could be better","This is a brilliant hotel. They have a saying “bring the out side in” meaning the hotels have the flavours of the local culture and here it’s perfect. A modern hotel but full of the old Paranakan culture. The rooms are spacious, individual and quirky. All decorated in the style of the surrounding region. The roof top pool is very welcome and the staff are lovely. I happen to love the area, lots of eateries. I didn’t try the Hotel Resturant. I really recommend this hotel",5
Coffee,Dinner Experience,"I stayed here for a one night stopover in Singapore. The hotel had all the design charm that Indigo is known for- bonuses such as complementary lollies in the room are a great touch. The room design is lovely - and Indigo’s signature of doing bathrooms uniquely and well came through. The bathroom, and especially the shower, was beautiful. The breakfast was also excellent. The staff were great and helpful. There was a real frustration with the lift which was slow (it seemed like only one was operating) and very hot. It meant that heading back to your room because you had forgotten something was a real drag. As much as I really liked the hotel, I probably wouldn’t stay there again due to its location. My memory is that it’s a 15 minute, $12-14 ride to the city, which is where",5
World traveler Kazakhstan,"Great place, friendly staff","Would love to stay longer at this Indigo. Not a fancy hotel, but very unique style and friendly staff. Breakfast is pretty good!

Juan,"Indigo price, hostel services","I booked Hotel Indigo to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday in May. When I first wrote an email to the front office, I wasn't being entertained until I emailed again, saying that I hope to leave a good review, then I received replies from Faris, the Acting Neighbourhood Host. I was very pleased with the arrangement in all our email thread for the past 1 week before my stay in Hotel Indigo. I arranged a courier to send the ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" banner with tape to the front desk and had them to decorate it for me by the window. Upon arriving at my room, I saw that the banner was down, and with such a big tape that I gave it to them, they actually only used a small piece to secure the banner which was a HUGE disappointment because I was expecting it to be up.

deedee,Lovely Staff and Lovely Neighborhood!,"I came to Indigo due it was a good rating in Tripadvisor for a business meeting. Just for one night. I just have a bas experience in the past in brand new Indigo Phuket, but I want to gave them a new chance. I request to have late check out at 2 pm to take a shower before my plane and they dennied me. They offer me to go upstairs to the pool facilities. In pool there is only a small locker room and open air showers with no shampoos or gels. Totally lied by frontdesk people and quite disapointing when I asked them a solution and just say me that’s all that they can do. About room is ok, confortable. Breakfast good, but nothing superb. Never again Indigo.",5

Audz_audz,Exploring neighbourhood inspired hotel,Great hotel with great decor & rooftop swimming pool. The reception staff were helpful and friendly and the bed was very comfortable with nice linen. Easy taxi service into the city including Garden by the Bay and other attractions. It is also close to Changi airport.,5
Sunflowa,It was wonderful stayed,"The Indigo in Katong is a quirky design hotel which we enjoyed a lot! We found it to be very relaxed and quiet for the size, the service was very good. The staff recommended us places to walk and see around and always welcomed us with a smile. They even kept our luggage for a couple of days while we went to an island nearby. Really great! We loved the design of the rooms, and enjoyed the nice big rooftop pool on a hot afternoon. Another thing that really stood out was the breakfast - outstanding! Katong is a wonderful area of Singapore and definitely worth being considered a base for a couple of days while in this amazing city. Lots of wonderful restaurants around, and the best Laksa in SG!!",5
alynaguilar05@gmail.com,This is a grest place!,"Recently stayed at this property (Repeat guest) and really loved the stay. Location is vibrant and full of options ranging from coffee to fine dining. Location is safe..as is all of Singapore. Close proximity to airport and central..without being in those congested, busy areas is awesome. Rooms are small, but efficient and beautifully decorated in local design. Rooms are quiet and it seems the hotel soundproofed the walls well. Shower water pressure is perfect! Perks like a foot soaking bath are unexpected, and welcome after a long days work or was long through Singapore. Bed was comfortable and bedding was soft. Towels were thick and absorbent and bath amenities were large sized and smelled great. I’ll keep staying here.. perfect hotel at a incredible price",5

We booked and paid for EAT PLAY STAY KATONG package and it was absolutely value for money as we will assigned a beautiful room (took loads of photos here :)) + a great view, sumptuous breakfasts for 2 persons at Baba Chews, $20 worth of dining credit which I spent on an afternoon tea (an ice lemon tea and an local otak toast) and a stunning POOL! It was totally relaxing for the both of us. The room was very welcoming and it make me feel like we are at home as it comes with a two-seater sofa, we can relax and have a game of carrom too! And the staff were friendly, we truly enjoyed our stay here :))",5
Zara P,Great place to stay,"I stayed in this hotel recently. It was really good. 1. They offer high standard customer service. Especially front office teams are very nice and professional. 2. Food was also delicious I really enjoyed the food 3. If you stay there u have to visit roof top swimming pool. It was very calm and more private than marina bay sands. 4. As usual, the bed is really comfortable. If i go back to singapore, i will stay in there again.",4

Pramod (PP),"Great business hotel, with a blend of traditional Peranakan Culture..",I wish I had booked to stay here more than one night - it's just delightful. Warm welcome from the staff on reception. My room (15th floor) is lovely - full of quirky and arty little details and treats - a bowl with foot spa products in for giving tired feet a quick treat; sweeties in jars; lovely smelling toiletries; fruit bowl and mini macaroons...Just lovely. The local area is great - a pretty part of Singapore and close to the airport for short stop overs. Lots to places to eat and shop near by and some lovely buildings - has a great feel. Roof top pool is great. I'm really impressed by this hotel. Will definitely book again.,5
liliant,Fabulous,Stayed for 1 night on way to Europe. Close to the airport with plenty of shopping and eateries nearby. Room was spacious neat and tidy. Excellent shower and comfy bed. Rooftop pool was nice. I was given a later checkout at no extra charge which was great.,5

Hans V,Magnificent location historically all the crab cut,"Indigo hotel is known for their love for popular neighbourhood and adopting local culture to reflect in their properties…this one in Katong/Singapore is no different. True to their philosophy, Hotel Indigo is not only situated in a culturally rich Katong locality, it has adopted the local Peranakan culture as it’s theme for this property. Katong locality used to be a sea-side residential area until mid-20th century, which had a unique & rich blend of cultural mix of Malay, Chinese & Europeans. It used to be a wealthy suburb which allowed fishermen families to co-exist and that reflected two sides of the society in a unique blend, until the time when Singapore’s growth started taking shape. In this cultural mix, one of the dominant culture was Peranakan culture and that’s what",5
99PrelimFinalJoy,Good alternative to Changi Business Park,We Always wanted to try out this place and just in time had a quest to complete for IHG rewards. It was nice to have a room with Katong view. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is well designed and stylish. We also managed to eat some of the recommended eateries near hotel. Thanks for the birthday surprise!,4
Giffy Giraffe,Successful transit sleepover,"This hotel has everything you need at a great price point. I loved our room. It was well laid out - beautiful textiles, good size, comfortable bed, and a wonderful mural (I really appreciated the fantastic and novel design concept.) Little treats are provided and the all natural toiletries smell wonderful. The gym and infinity pool were well maintained and put to good use. I had no problems w noise. Staff was cheery and helpful. I only took a star off for the problems we has w our ac - room was comfortable but barely - I felt we had a faulty unit but maintenance said otherwise. Who knows. I’d still return.",5

Upintheairtoomuch,Nice Hotel Nice Neighborhood - (but not in the action if that is what you want),"Business trip with mtgs in CBP, and so opted for the 10 min taxi ride each way rather than staying within CBP. Standard room is OK, small - no desk - but interesting bathroom set up with wall to ceiling windows... haven’t seen that before ! I had the included breakfast rate, and food was OK to good... small but adequate buffet... hot breakfast items orderable. Staff friendly. Surrounding Katong area has plenty of food and bars. Bars are OK, food hit and miss.",5
Claire S,Great stay on honeymoon,"I am breaking a long trip into two by taking a 24-hour break in Singapore. Indigo was great for this. To me the main selling points are the nice quiet rooms. They are compact and cozy, but comfortable and restful. The staff are attentive and helpful. The lobby rather spartan, but most everything you might need is there. The breakfast restaurant is very nice and their coffee is good. It’s all a decent midpoint between over-the-top high end and functional minimalist. I will use this hotel again ... in fact I will use it again in about a week from now.",5
Si P,Try this hotel!,"We booked this hotel because we saw it has such good reviews everywhere so we really held out expectation high. And once we walked in our room, the stylish decoration of the room really caught our eye. We thought we will really enjoy our stay until mid night when our next door guest moved in we realized there is something so wrong with this hotel. The wall is literally paper thing. We can hear our next door guest coughing all night. And we really don't blame him because we can also hear every word he talks on the phone, him shaving his beard, him zipping his zipper...... there is no privacy and it was super noisy. We stayed in IHG hotels worldwide and have never run into a hotel with such bad sound proof. We stayed in New York before where hotels are really pricy and noisy but",5
Kartika T,satisfying visit,"I liked it here. Katong is a nice part of Singapore. Great local architecture and plenty of small local restaurants, and some shopping. Only a short Grab ride from anywhere, but if you want to stay in the middle of the action go elsewhere. Breakfast was really really good. The rooms were really really cool, large enough, and functional. Full floor to ceiling windows, even in the shower for the adventurous. Rooftop infinity pool was spectacular. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Can't go wrong.",5
Tanya Brownrigg,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights as the first stop on our honeymoon and loved it! This was our second time to Singapore, we much preferred the Katong location over Orchard Road where we stayed previously. The view from the room was amazing, it was very clean and staff were friendly. We loved the smartphone we could use for free during our stay, it made navigating the streets and finding local restaurants we’d be recommended very easy. The location being out of the main city was not an issue, cheap and quick taxi trips got us to the sights with no issues.",5
Isha S,Amazing area and rooms,"Amazing hotel and beautiful area Staff are fantastic Highly recommend for any type of stay Have stayed here 3 times now and the food is great, rooms always clean, staff always there to help and friendly and a lovely pool and garden area Wouldn’t stay anywhere else now when I visit",5

Area around has several eateries and hence easy to find a good meal.,5
MissCelaneus,Charming and well located,"We were so impressed with Hotel Indigo and plan to revisit again! The decor from the foyer to the rooms is amazing colours and design unique and it is easy to see that the Katong area much of which is peranekan is reflected in the decor. Now for the important bit, check in one of the best we have had if I recall correctly Shakeel did our check in, during our stay Jennifer who worked in reception was amazing with her customer service. Our room was large and modern we were on the 13th floor and had views across Katong. The toilet was separate to the bathroom, the bathroom itself was unique with bright design and importantly immaculate, the shower had a rain shower and the size of the shower cubicle was really large, good hot water and soft towels and the botanicals range of",5

Bus stop a short walk from the hotel.",5
Guide Mi,As expected of an IHG hotel~,"Was really an awesome stay and value for money. Went for my anniversary with my wife. Was greeted with a nice cup of coffee upon arrival. The staff were friendly and assisted us with our enquiries. Went to the room and it was beautifully decorated as with my request to add on roses/cards/snacks/balloons to surprise my wife. The room itself is unique and well thought off. Can see the pride the hotel takes for the rooms. And I like the attention they give to the minor details like having a DIY ""free"" foot spa as part of the theme. You can walk around the vicinities of the hotel to help yourself to a range of food or massages if you like. The breakfast was awesome and one of the better ones I have for a hotel. Check out was also pretty fast. I would highly recommend this",5
James W,Quirky boutique hotel that checks the boxes,"We found the hotel very well located for a weekend visit, at mid-distance between the airport and the downtown buzz. It's a quiet neighbourhood of little shops and restaurants, very near Joo Chiat Road and its heritage colonial houses. The hotel in itself is adorable, the style is a mix of impeccably clean modern with kitschy flea market chinese details. The rooms are relatively spacious for Singapore and for the price. Ours had a fun shower room with a view on the city through the bay window. And of course there's the rooftop swimming-pool. The service is cheerful and helping. They found and booked bus tickets at a nearby bus stop for us. Breakfast in the restaurant next door is excellent with a wide variety of dishes. Delicious eggs benedict. All in all an excellent",5
Ang W,Excellent,"Based on a recommendation here we choose this hotel and just simply loved it. The room, the interior, the gym and the pool on the roof. The breakfast was various and delicious. I also loved the music was played in the common places as lobby and the roof. I liked the candy selection from the hotel in the vitrine of the room. I also took some home :) The restaurants and supermarkets are near by. We spent only 4 days there, but it is just a lovely place to stay if you are on a business trip. The airport is very close and the offices in the center are about 25-30 min taxi drive.",5
valerie,Wonderful stay,"I've been a loyal user of IHG hotels, and this hotel definitely live up to their name. You might want to try their room which has the bath tub in it, since the bath tub is really good with the dragon being carved to the site of the bath tub. The room size is just nice, not too big but not too small. And it really gives off that kind of traditional vibe. If you'd like to experience how the peranakan style feels like, then stay with this hotel might really let you feel like one. Great~!",5
HL L,Lovely area to stay in,"The Katong neighborhood on the East Coast of Singapore is not easy to get to. A 10 minute ride from Changi Airport, it's not exactly close to the subway, and taxis are not as frequent as in the city center. But if you like heritage, this hotel is built on top of the bones of the old local police station. The neighborhood is Peranakan---that is, immigrant Chinese/Malay, like from way back. The storefronts and architecture are reminiscent of Singapore 50 years ago. The rooms in the old Police Stations (Floor 7 and below) reflect the antique heritage. Like either an old police dormitory or else prisoner cell, the rooms have no desks. The coffee table is an old Bangqi (Chinese pool) table. The bathroom sink is a converted sewing machine footpedal stand. And the chairs are",5
shazzynoor,nice place at a pretty good location,"Had a staycation here at the room w the bathtub. Impeccable service, great view, and a quaint pretty rooftop infinity pool.

Katarzyna K,3 days stay,"Chose to stay in Indigo Katong mainly due to the location. I wanted a hotel in the east side of Singapore so that I could explore the area. While not near a MRT station, there are many buses available which brings you to the city centre. Hence, I would say it is quite convenient. Service wise is very friendly, and good internet connection. The hotel design is Peranakan style, which is a nod towards the Peranakan roots of this area. The room itself has some accents like the easy chair, wooden clogs, which is quite cute. However, the design of the room is slightly inconvenient. Firstly, the toilet is separate from the shower area and located right next to the entrance of the room. Also, the shower has huge window panes which faces the garden. While you can pull down the blinds and",5
Matthew Z,Very Good,"location is good. connected to katong square which is pretty quiet but i12 katong is just 2min walk away. or maybe 1. service is great and the room is pretty. peranakan themed, even had a footsoak bowl provided. but my favorite of all is the carrom board! which hotel provides carromboard in the room? this one did and my family had such a great time!",5
Fiona M,"Authentic, characterful, bit different","First time staying in this awesome property and won't be the last. I have been to Singapore many a times and I have never ventured out this far east but I am so glad I did this time around as I am in love with this property, especially the neighbourhood. This amazing hotel represents both modern and traditional design concepts. The colonial rooms mimics the local culture and the amazing design of the buildings that lined the streets just facing the property. Our rooms were very spacious and it has a bathroom and a half which was very convenient. The outdoor infinity pool overlooks the colourful and magical neighborhood. Next to Intercontinental Hotels, Indigo Properties are my second favourite accommodation when traveling as they showcase and represent the culture and",5

It has personality, style, comfort, extra friendly efficient staff and is in a fun and different location - Katong area with its bars, shops, restaurants, Chinese architecture, colour.....ok, its a 10-16 dollar ( sing) taxi ride into the city and not on metro line yet but don’t let this put you off. It’s only a short taxi ride anyway The interior design is colourful and gorgeous.

Geoff F,Great location and value for money,"Pros: 1) This hotel is situated in the suburb of Katong, which between the city centre and the airport. Katong is a traditional stronghold of the Peranakan culture. Right opposite the hotel is a row of shops with architecture from the turn of the 20th century. 2) There are many restaurants are bars as well as a small shopping mall with a supermarket within 5 minutes walk. However, on the other side of the hotel, in Marine Parade, you will find Parkway Parade - a larger shopping mall with everything. 3) Transport, as always in Singapore, is convenient. Taxis are cheap and depending on the traffic, it’s not a long ride into Orchard Road. 4) The rooms are extremely unique though not large. The rooms are designed to reflect the Peranakan culture of Katong. Little touches like",5
Sly,A truly excellent hotel,"I’ve stayed in a few Hotel Indigos now and they’ve all been fantastic! As a hotel chain, I definitely think they are one of the best - and this new hotel in Katong is also fab! If you’re tired of generic ‘white box executive’ hotels - This is the place for you! I LOVE the colourful decor and interesting rooms. We had a standard room which was still fabulous - with amazing floor to ceiling windows high above the local skyline, a great show, comfy bed, big TV with English language channels, good tea and coffee in the room, and a lovely couch area. Staff were very friendly and presented us with fruits and sweets upon check in - a lovely and most welcome touch. :) Also in the rooms there was a stool, decorated tub, and a kit with instructions for providing a foot bath /",5
SMITHAL88,Good location,"Stayed five nights following new year . Super location in the middle of the shops and restaurants in historic Katong. Classy hotel designed in traditional style different from usual hotel rooms. Super roof top pool with great views. All Staff were very friendly and helpful and made the trip memorable. Will definitely stay again, highly recommended.",5
Harry S,Great Quality and Hospitalty,"Brand new hotel, excellent room and very comfortable beds! We have adjoining double and twin. Rooftop pool is great. Didn’t have room service and the breakfast was ok. Cooked breakfast could do with some TLC. Front desk very friendly and helpful and gave us a late check out which helped a lot Would thoroughly recommend the hotel",4
MikeyLeeds,Fantastic Hotel,"I find it hard to put in words how much I enjoyed this hotel. The room was beautiful, contaned everything we needed and was impeccably cleaned by housekeeping. It also included many nuggets of Singaporean culture (a set of Chinese slippers, a game of carrom and complimentary candy were displayed in our room and made available for purchase at reception). The breakfast, taking place at the neighboring restaurant called Baba Chews, was delicious. Staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. Despite the location not being in the very center of Singapore, it was very accessible by public transport. Our stay was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore - very recommended!",5
AdillaHays,One of a kind,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff with a well designed clean, modern room. I am slightly biased as i used to live down the road from this hotel, though I do believe it's in a great location. Situated between downtown and the airport, this is a great base for some exploring. You've also got a great selection of restaurants for local food nearby. No complaints at all for this hotel, would stay again if I needed to be on East Coast.",5
Shortstep,Great,The friendliness and compassion of all staff was absolutely outstanding. Our two rooms were immaculately clean and had a very nice and individual interior. One should not stay at this hotel without using the spectacular pool on the roof top.,5
Andylmj,Great room and breakfast,"This hotel is a jewel in Singapore's Katong district. The location is great, just far enough or of the city to be quiet, whilst still am easy taxi or bus ride into town. The MRT will be extending here in the next year or so. The staff are wonderful, friendly and very helpful, they can't do enough for you. The rooms are brilliant and the bed is probably one of the best I've slept in in the world. All in all I can't recommend this hotel enough, if you are going to Singapore you must try and stay here. Fantastic",5
OneDarren,Stay at this hotel. Please?,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Charming hotel, and one can feel its newness. The room was such a nice change from the typical hotel rooms - I absolutely loved that everything was different, and I spent some time checking-out the items in the room (I usually don't bother, who does really, especially when on a work trip). I even read all the explanatory notes (placed at the foot bath, near the complimentary candy jar, at the carrom board etc) - they were a delight! I was a little let down by the service though. Perhaps I had raised my expectations a little too high, having read many reviews singing praises about the service. All front desk personnel were polite and efficient - but I was expecting the extra ooomph, I've experienced better service in many other hotels. Beds and",5
Menrva26,Perfect as always.,"In Singapores east a bit off the beaten path (the next MRT is a bus ride away) this is a new hotel designed in a beautiful peranakan style, from the pillows to the general decor. Close to many great food places and I2Katong mall and a short walk or jog from East Coast Park I can totally recommend this place with its exceptionally friendly staff.",5
Jas,Highly recommended for a staycation,"Stayed 2 nights with my wife in Dec 2018 Room: 5 of 5 balls The room has an interesting theme unlike most bigger hotel chains, with the bath and toilet area covered with “flowery baroque style” tiles. The room is filled with colours, from the monochrome background to the colourful sofa and carpet. It might look like a colour explosion to some, but it was definitely delightful to me and my wife. Location: 4.5 of 5 balls It’s not central where it’s near attractions, but the Katong neighbourhood, the nearby food and East Coast Park offers something a different respite. Bathtub: 5 of 5 balls This warrants a separate rating on its own. It’s a big off-white tub capable of letting 2 slim adults in. The outer part of the tub itself has carvings that suit the bathroom tiles. It was",5
KohAWL,Guests are at their heart of Service Excellence!,"Let me first start by telling you how I found this hotel. On trip advisor, I sort hotels in Singapore by review rating. Then I sieve out those that are above SG$300. Voila. There she is, Hotel Indigo. Affordable, yet highly rated. If it wasn't for its size, it'd probably beat out large expensive hotels in fame. I haven't stayed in many hotels, but I've stayed at enough to know quality. THIS hotel, my friends, deserves your stay. The hotel itself looks new, both inside and out. Everything is shiny and clean, but it's a little small. Service is excellent. Check in and out, room service, extra requests. All were met with efficiency and quality. How much ARE you paying your staff for such quality Hotel Indigo? And yet the rooms are affordable?! Impossible. Yet here we are. The",5
Kalindi D,Peranakan!,"Staying here just gets better and better. It always feels like I'm coming home. Room Service has improved tremendously over these few mths, fast and in point. Beds are such a delight, we practically stayed in it the whole break. Shout out to my fav girl at the restaurant. She is such a delightful girl. I'm glad to be an IHG member and hope to be back soon at Indigo.",5
fredgolding,Great spot,"The hotel was recommended by my best friend as she recently had her staycation at the hotel. The hotel was tastefully decorated and furnished, from the hotel lobby to the room. The focus on the Peranakan culture was just nice. The only downside is that the entrance to the hotel lobby could be easily missed as it is “hidden” from the main road. The room was cosy and had a pair of clogs and carrom table. The toilet had a few “vintage” items like a plastic string chair, complimentary White Rabbit Hard candy sweets and the basin converted from a Singer sewing machine which added to the charm. The infinity pool overlooks the Katong neighbourhood. The day and night views were amazing! The restaurant, Baba Chew, serves pretty authentic Peranakan food too. There are many cafes,",4
Lasse23,Great place to stay,"It was probably my 6th visit to the hotel once again. The excellent service, hospitality, hygiene and comfort are major reasons why I returned repeatedly. As we know, the month of December is often the peak period of travels. As such, it is inevitable that the hotel has high occupancy and miscommunication may occur every now and then. However, the hotel staff were quick in rectifying the problem with outstanding professionalism and service. In particular, Hidayah rendered her utmost support and assistance at the front desk, facilitating the quick resolution to the issue. I was definitely impressed by how the issue was resolved, and definitely how positive the customer service was maintained and how they really show how every guest is their priority all the time. Furthermore,",5
Gordon M,Uniquely decorated new hotel,"A lovely clean hotel in the east with cheerful staff. I stayed here for 5 days with my husband and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The location is very convenient as there are bus-stops within less than 50 meters! There is a taxi stand in the mall next to the hotel (I12 Katong). Also there are plenty of hip eating joints to suit every taste bud and pocket! Lots of shopping options too! The rooms are large and differently designed, toilet and bathing areas are separate. It is very tastefully decorated and is very clean as it is new and hope that it stays this way. The swimming pool area is large and I loved it ..nice views, lots of breeze and was very relaxing. The staff was always very cheerful and helpful. The rooms are cleaned once a day, on the first day we had an extremely good",5

Lw2Lng,over-rated,"We stayed here for two nights en route to Bali-and liked it from the moment we stepped in. The hotel met all of our expectations. Staff were great throughout our stay, the room spacious and lovely decorated, the bed comfortable. Everyone was not only efficient (the way you would expect it to be in Singapore) but welcoming and attentive. We had a nice room on the 13th floor and were surprised by it’s big size (considering how much of a premium space is in a city like Singapore). Furthermore, they really did a good job blending in the traditional Perankan heritage style into the room’s modern comfort. The complimentary mobile phone provided came more than handy as it made navigation around the city very easy if you don’t have any local data. The Indigo might not be cheap if",5
FFM9,Funky hotel in a vibrant hood,"The rooms are spacious and are uniquely decorated with eclectic furnishings.

PeeGadget,What a delightful surprise!,"Lovely boutique hotel with peranakan theme. Near airport and shopping centre. Booked the room with bathtub. Overlooking the neighbourhood. Nice infinity pool. From the rooftop pool you can see the co trial tower of changi airport, Singapore post, ecp as well as the city area! Hotel breakfast was really good and amazing. The staffs were so nice and approachable. No complaints so far. There's a 24 gym too!",5
novita77,Away from the main tourist belt ....,"If you think having a good night’s rest and a delightful stay is defined by : 1. the audible and incessant sound of the air-conditioner thermostat switching on and off , throughout the night : 2. unsecured curtains dangling 3. constant water dripping in the shower 4. room furnishings that carry ‘hidden pricetags’ 5. furniture ‘obstacles’ guaranteed to trip you at night ... then Hotel Indigo Katong is the hotel for you. p/s : parking is ‘complimentary daily’-a deceptively generous perk, that requires clarification - ideal check in procedure for a weary traveller",5
TJSing2008,Perfect for hosting people,"The hotel is brand new and located in one of the must see historical neighbourhoods of Singapore, lined up with old chinese houses, restaurants and stores. All rooms are identical, some facing the city view and Katong historical houses. This hotel and its rooms are all about embedding you in the local history, culture and architecture, more than being just ""another hotel"". Rooms are filled with colourful and funky furniture, even an old closet filled with antique China and pictures from the nearby historical houses are all over the hotel walls. The hotel theme is clear. The rooms are build like the Chinese traditional houses in Singapore, narrow and long, no worries there is plenty space, but it has indeed an interesting design, with all the spaces being one after the other,",5
Karjanmed,Good one but not very functional,"This was my first time staying at an Indigo property and I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was beautifully designed, clean and the Deluxe room was spacious. The room I was provided was an adjoining room. My neighbours were quite loud and all of their conversations travelled freely through the closed adjoining room door. I phoned the front desk and they were very helpful. They spoke with the neighbours and when that didn’t help they immediately offered to change my room. They were very apologetic and the next day checked in on me, provided me with a handwritten apology note and a plate of lovely chocolates. To me that is customer service at its best. The follow up on my concern made my stay a ten out of ten. The other notable item about this hotel is their attention to",5

MrPhileasF,Great and relaxing,"This week we have hosted 3 friends who were in town for a few days. Our condo is too small, so we wanted somewhere funky, modern and convenient. Indigo ticked all the boxes. They loved the location, and it’s closeness to good food and great coffee, the rooftop was perfect for relaxing and catching up on emails, and the breakfasts had a great range and were delicious. The rooms all had city views, and the floor to ceiling windows and eclectic decor made it a great place to relax. The staff were helpful, and check in and check out were all quick and effortless.",5

If you are looking to spend more time in the room(in the evenings) and combine that with good service, indigo is up there. Good location and there are quite a bit eatery out there within couple mins walk. I dont recommend the in house restaurant..kinda off expensive with limited choice. Overall a good hotel.",5
Tony B,Trendy Hotel,Mix feeling when it comes to hotel staff. Most receptionists are very friendly but a few are extremely standoffish. The room is very..vibrant with furniture in place that serves no purpose but taking up room. The pool is very nice and there is not that many people. Breakfast is excellent with a-la-carte menu that changes everyday. No big problem but for the price i probably will just stay in the orchard rode area.,5
Wella Murda,Fabulous Hotel and Lovely Room,"If you have a stopover in Singapore or you just want to relax, then skip downtown and head for Hotel Indigo Katong Singapore, it's only a 15 minute ride from the airport and it is a more local part of town and you can still find plenty of shopping and good restaurants close by the hotel. The hotel is like most in the Indigo brand aesthetically pleasing with lots small touches of grandeur. The lobby is nice and open with Chinese colour themes and on the roof there is a big infinity pool as well as a nice sundeck and a sizable gym with several machines and various equipments. The rooms are very well planned and with nice touches as a Chinese foot bath and Chinese pottery. The room is also equipped with Handy, the personal assistant, and handles all the modern life gadget issues.",5
Stephen W,Lovely hotel,"This my 3rd times come to Singapore, and I preffered to stay in Katong for my first day. Cause I love their neighborhood, nice and quite. I love this hotel as love as this neighborhood. One of my preferences wasn't fulfilled by this hotel, I would like to stay in room close to the elevator. Due to I would love doing more activities in this area such a like food, shops, gym etcetera. Good credit to Tiffany as our neighborhood host. Thanks for your service.",5
Majewel1987,Quiet part of SIngapore,"This was my second stay at the Hotel Indigo. Again I chose it based on the style of the hotel and the location in Katong. It is close to the airport, and only a short taxi ride into the city centre, but is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Like all Indigo Hotels,the style is a little quirky and different which is great when you spend a lot of time in chain hotels. The pool and gym facilities are excellent and the staff really friendly. Their is a restaurant attached to the hotel, but I would not classify it as a bar, but there are plenty of options within walking distance. Will certainly use on my next trip to Singapore.",5
RMHMT,Great boutique hotel,"This is the first time my friend and I come to singapore. We booked this hotel with type premier king bed with bathtub.

This hotel has awesome infinity pool, we very enjoyed and could be took a photo with amazing view. Tomorrow morning we have breakfast on the first floor, the staff was friendly for welcoming to us. Over all We were happy stay in Indigo Hotel (fabulous hotel) But we have problems goes to MRT, its so far from this hotel. We should used bus to MRT.",5
Ryandall,Wonderful stay at beautifully decorated boutique hotel!,Had a really lovely stay in touch his hotel. We got drinks at reception to greet us and the staff were brilliant throughout.

The staff were excellent and obliging, and were very attentive to detail. Katong was away from the centre of the city, but it was relaxing and not crowded. There were plenty of quality places to eat.

Even though it's a little distance from the city centre, there are lots of places to eat next to the hotel and on the street just in front. If you have a car, they can give you a voucher for the carpark right next door, and from the hotel it's only a short drive to the city atractions.",5

I also took advantage of the swimming pool which was well maintained with a great view of the city area. The hotel is also not far from the airport or the city though there is no MRT nearby.

Tim B,Highly recommended,"Highlights included comfortable beds, a very good breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, friendly staff, an interesting neighbourhood with buildings and shops that reflect the diverse cultural heritage of Singapore and proximity to the airport if you are only visiting for a short while. There is no MRT station nearby. The Gardens by the Bay are a relatively short taxi ride away and there is a shopping mall with eateries and supermarket very close by at 112 Katong. My only quibble is that having asked for a room in a quiet location we were assigned a room next to an adjoining room. Fortunately this was only occupied for a few hours after our arrival, during which time we could hear our neighbour sneezing. It would have been a problem if the room had remained occupied for the",5

Beatrizgv,The best night,"I booked a one night at this hotel celebrating my wedding anniversary with my wife. We decided on hotel Indigo as it was one of the newer hotels in the vicinity and the fact that it is a boutique hotel. Check in was relatively smooth, the offering of a welcome drink was nice especially given that singapore's weather can be very hot and humid. My wife and I were ushered to the lift after check in and given a short run through of the hotel's facilities. The design of the whole interior of the hotel has a strong peranakan influence. The rooms were filled with furniture which reminded me of Singapore in the 50s and 60s. The hotel reflected the nonya heritage that the location is known for-katong. I personally found the feel of the room to be a bit ostentatious with the paintings",5
Bikene L,Perfect hotel,We had a fabulous stay at Indigo Singapore. The hotel is beautifully decorated in Asia Art Deco. All the staff are very friendly and welcoming. We had a superior room facing out over the Katong neighbourhood and the view was amazing. The showers are spacious with fixed and removable shower heads. The king bed was very comfortable. The room was very quiet with only minimal noise from the next room and corridor. The rooftop infinity pool is fantastic. Breakfast was in the restaurant in front of the hotel and is very delicious with east and west food options. Regular buses to everywhere in SG are 100 meters walk. Parkway centre is about 5 min walk. A lot of great restaurants right across the road. Highly recommend for business or leisure stay. Good for kids too.,5
ferrisgirl,Fabulous hotel,"I think that I could honestly talk about my love for Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong all day long. From the moment I walked in and took a look around, it instantly felt like home. The lobby was full of light and color, and I was mesmerized by (what I learned was) the Peranakan culture. After being offered a tasty iced coffee at check-in, I made my way up to the room on the 13th floor. When I entered my room, I honestly felt like I was entering a movie set because it was just SO colorful (and right up my alley!). Take all this color and historical significance, and pair it with one of the most comfortable hotel beds I’ve ever experienced, and let me tell you… it’s difficult to pry yourself away! When I finally managed to make it downstairs, there was an amazing a la carte",4

All was ready when we arrived - very friendly reception staff and a gorgeous design throughout the hotel. Our room had a great view on the 8th floor, beautiful decor and a huge comfortable bed. Loved all the little touches - foot bowl and salts, traditional game, and clogs, power points where you need them and a toilet separate from the shower. Very spacious. The rooftop pool is smaller than it looks in the photos but not crowded and a nice place to wallow and look at the views. We loved the Katong area - no high rises and lots of cool shops and eateries - it was our first time there and we would like to spend more time there.",5

SeahKC,Quirky but Nice hotel,"I made a last minute decision to book a room here as I had stayed at another Indigo theme hotel two weeks earlier in Berlin and loved it. The hotel is built around an old colonial heritage police station and the lounge and rooms in particular reflect the culture, character and history of the surrounding neighborhood. As a photographer I was just so impressed with the colour and attention to detail in the rooms it had me entranced! Lots of cool stuff to look at and the shower opens out to floor to ceiling window glass to take in the view and there was a foot bowl with assorted, salts and creams to give your feet a soak! Only downside with my room was it lacked a proper deskspace/chair to put in some serious work on your laptop. As a regular lap swimmer the pool on the rooftop was",5

Its located in a lovely neighbourhood, Katong/Joo Chiat where there are lots of eateries (from local to international, from cheap eat to classy restaurant). This area is full of expats around, so good coffee is available too if you dont like the local Kopi.

Check in was a breeze and in no time I was in the room. Room was well appointed and all amenities well provided. Layout was different from most conventional hotel where the toilet and bathroom was separated at both ends of the room. Toilet near the entrance and the bath area at the other end. Facilities in the hotel was adequate with a well sized infinity pool which has a breathtaking view especially when night falls.

Great looking roof pool although we did not have time to use it! We had a great breakfast in the restaurant next door - again superior to One Farrer. All the staff we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. Although slightly outside of the main centre a $15 taxi gets you there in 15-20 minutes.

Absolutely no traffic noise. Staff were friendly and helpful. The local neighbourhood is worth exploring. There's a trendy cafe/homewares and design centre about 300 metres along East Coast Rd (towards the airport), called DoubleJoy. And if you walk to Eunos MRT, you'll stroll past impressive homes and gardens. And across the street from the hotel is an excellent gelato shop! Oh, and the rooftop pool is as good as it looks.

Some brill restaurants nearby, and the onsite restaurant does an excellent coffee. Coast is a short walk in one direction including shopping centres etc, and in the other direction is the bustling Geylang district. Would consider staying there again if we returned. Rooftop pool is fantastic, but way too busy with families whenever we went there. Service was very different to the other hotels we'd stayed at in Singapore (including other IHG properties), staff need to concentrate more on acknowledging guests passing through the foyer, and smiling at them *before* they finish whatever task they are doing.",5

My husband thought the bath was too small but it is a round stone bath meant for you to sit in and be immersed in a deep bath experience which I loved. The room comes with free Nespresso coffee making facility, bespoke toiletries and bath salts! Ok so I didn't use the gaming table for games but what a great coffee table option. If you like the conventional sterile business hotel then this is not for you. Breakfast was great with daily specials. There are a couple of shopping malls close by and although not close to underground mtr, it was easy to get taxis from the 112 shopping mall next to the hotel. The buildings in katong are beautiful and lots of restaurants to choose from nearby.",5
Simi,Perfect stay in Singapore,"The Hotel Indigo is an eclectic hotel in a cool area of Singapore, surrounded by nice restaurants and a hip neighborhood. The rooms are decorated well with wall decorations, but furniture is aimed more toward tourists versus business travelers. The desk is a card table, office chair a wicker couch, lounge chair a plastic waterproof saucer. Nice to read a book, play games with kids; just not effective work place. Breakfast was limited, small fruit selection with choice of several hot dishes to order. Take advantage of the neighborhood with lots of local flavors.",5
jlin113,"An immersive cultural experience. Beautiful, chic property. Highly recommend!","Our deluxe king room had loads of character and lovely ambience. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and I liked that the toilet and shower were separate. The breakfast at Baba Chews was simply the best I've had in Asia.",4
ScorpiusLeo,Nice Hotel Away From The City,"We had a very nice stay at Indigo Katong. Service was friendly, very welcoming and quick. Rooms are super nice with very comfortable bed. The pool on the roof-top is very clean and gives nice views over the colourful houses of Katong. We did not have breakfast. Lots of small Reataurants and shops in front of hotel - great hotel in great area!",5
Suresh018,Good service,"My boyfriend and I stayed in this beautiful Hotel for his birthday. I texted the hotel manager before we arrived there and requested the Hotel to arrange the room in a special way to surprise him. And they did! The Hotel Indigo Katong wrote a card for my boyfriend and they put some paper origami on the bed. Their friendliness made our stay a very special one. The room was spotlessly clean, the hotel including the pool and the gym area were in a very good shape. We would definetly stay here again and recommend this hotels for everybody who is looking for a great Hotel in Singapore. The feeling we got in this Hotel really gave us the chance to relax, recover and enjoy Singapore.",5
topgirljay,A Gem,"I stayed at Hotel Indigo Katong for 3 nights and enjoyed every minute -- almost didn't want to leave the room! (But you must walk around the neighborhood... it's a heritage town, so a lot of pre-war architecture). In the room, I loved the artwork, the colorful furniture, and the whimsical amenities that make you curious about Peranakan culture (such as wooden slippers, carrom board game pieces, and a ""Good Morning Towel""). The room definitely had a personality of its own and is unlike any I've ever stayed in. On the rooftop there is an infinity pool with panoramic views of the city. We did have lunch and breakfast at the restaurant Baba Chews and the food was absolutely wonderful... think I'm going to want Laksa for breakfast every day now! I highly recommend Hotel Indigo in",5
Elinor D,Brilliant Hotel,"Away from the city yet conveniently located near many nice cafes and restaurants. Walking distance to 112 Katong Mall and Parkway Parade and a less than 10 minute drive to East Coast Beach. Sumptuous breakfast spread, clean and cosy rooms and friendly staff plus a cool rooftop pool. Would go again.",5
Stefan K,Perfect Hotel,Rosa at katong indigo takes special care in serving breakfast at restaurant near reception. Good hotel with infinity pool. Overall good experience Nice rooms clean spacey Staff is courteous Quiet location Shopping areas within 5 minutes walk.,5
CarinaAndIvo,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"This hotel is a real find. Bursting with personality, it cheers you up just to pull up in front of the place. From the vertical gardens, to the op art lift, and then on to those stunning bedrooms. So individual. So quirky and such fun. I felt good every time i entered. Lovely roof top pool and attentive staff. I so wanted to give this place 5 stars but i left an item of clothing behind and emailed to report. Not so much as a reply. Come on Indigo, you can do better than this. Its a minute to answer an email and is part of the customer relation experience.",5
jodwhy68,Beautiful!,"What a beautiful hotel - The attention to detail made by the Hotel Indigo brand team is brilliant! The rooms are Peranakan inspired and really reflect the traditions of Singapore, particularly the area around the Hotel in Katong and Joo Chiat. The room was very spacious and decoration was wonderful without compromising function and comfort 10/10. The facilities included with the hotel were also lovely, great infinity pool with a view and a good little gym. There were also sunset yoga classes advertised although we didn’t partake. Staff were very helpful and always friendly. In particular we had a very good experience on checking in. We arrived well before the official check in time, after landing in the morning, but staff made every effort to ensure we were comfortable in",5
Cabibti,Boutique at its best,"We really enjoyed our two Nights at the Indigo Hotel. The room was big with nice interior and a very comfortable bed. Maye a litte noise-sensitive We liked the location of the hotel in the middle of Katong with all its chinese shop houses, restaurants and small shops. A perfect contrast to the big-city life atmosphere of downtown. The roof top offers stunning views over the city, the pool is perfect to cool off in the afternoon. Breakfast was deliciouse. They do really good coffee. Restaurant stuff is sometimes a bit uncoordinated, very ambitiouse tough. Good value for Singapore. We‘ll come back.",5
Sylvia K,Nostalgically Modern and Comfortable,"Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong is an amazing boutique hotel! One of the best boutique hotel we ever stayed. Everything is well selected and decorated, we were simply in love with all. The breakfast is served in a close restaurant and it was also really good. The neighbourhood is fantastic and very typical. We took a look on the surroundings and we found the cute houses of Katong, so beautiful! Definitely recommend!",5
nicolettewong,Charming boutique hotel with character,"I just spent a week at the Hotel Indigo and I couldn't be happier with my stay. From the friendly staff to the beautiful rooms and facilities to the fantastic included breakfast, this hotel is truly a gem. It is located away from the main part of town (which is why we chose it) but only a quick cab ride to most of the main attractions around town.",4
KohAWL,Precious Gem in the Heartlands!,This is the second Indigo hotel we’ve stayed at. This boutique hotel offers unique in room amenities and has fun bohemian type decor which is authentic to the local area. It’s just gorgeous! Check out the photos.,5
Roger Widmer,Fantastic boutique hotel,"Occasionally, my sister and I will check into Hotel Indigo over the weekend for a short stay-cation. I like the location of the hotel as it is in the fringe of Singapore's city center - there is a direct buses to Suntec, Marina Square, Orchard, Raffles Place, to name a few. The closest shopping mall is next block, Katong Shopping Mall and Parkway Parade is a stone throw away (back of the hotel). You are literally spoil for choice on shopping and food. There are many eateries around the hotel and right downstairs, there is a bar (starkers) where they have freshly brewed beers (in-house). The hotel is very clean and inviting with the theme of Katong history that is basically rich with Peranakan influence. Hence, the tiles in the toilet, the decors are very classic, yet",5
JuusoJT,Stylish hotel with good location and great service,"I had my first staycation at this hotel and was so impressed with the attention to detail. They really carried the Peranakan culture throughout every part of the hotel, from the spittoon in the room and lanterns at the lift lobby that lights up to indicate the lifts are here. The service was excellent, very accommodative. The bed was nice and fluffy. TV has good range of channels. Breakfast was interesting too, it had local favourites like dough fritter (you tiao) and western options like eggs benedict. Would recommend this to visitors who want to explore the local culture and don't mind being away from the city (little public transport nearby too).",5
Niels M,Magic!,"This boutique hotel is infused with strong Peranakan culture. Even the entrance to the hotel lays slightly obscured, just like in the old Peranakan houses. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, with warm lighting and parquet flooring. The hotel boasts of an excellent infinity pool. The view is particularly alluring, especially at sunset. Good local eateries are just a stone throw's away and the locality is generally quiet.",5
Nathan1000,A beautiful feeling,"A real gem hidden in the middle of Katong. I always stayed in Katong when I am in Singapore but it was the first time in Indigo. You feel welcome from the moment you step into the hotel, it is quirky but still functional. The room was decorated very special but great. I will certainly be back.",5
Menrva26,"Excellent, as always.","Very stylish hotel In Katong area. We felt very wellcome when arrived. Quite small room, but nice interior. Very beautiful bathroom with a magnificent view from the shower. Bed was ok, pillows too hard. Breakfast was versatile, juices in small bottles were fantastic. Staff was more than nice. There was a small infinity pool on the roof but bar service only by the phone. Plenty of local restaurants in the hoods.",5
rosey365,Go the extra mile,"Hotel Indigo Katong is just lovely... lokated in Katong close to the center (about 15 min.

Akinobu-Ray,Old world charm of Peranakan Culture,"If ever you plan to build or renovate a home or office, the first thing you should do is call Hotel Indigo and get the name of their interior designer. An amazing array of colours, great combinations of furniture - in the room, in the lobby and in the very relaxing lounge area (which is where I am now sitting before taking a taxi to nearby Changi airport.) Katong is not necessarily a place to visit, although the old-style buildings are often well-preserved and very colourful and are well worth seeing. But for an overnight stay, Katong is ideally located and the good vibe that you will get from Hotel Indigo will help you on your next flight.",5
orchid91,"Great stay, wonderful staff !","Hotel Indigo has definitely become my first choice of hotels in Singapore. I stayed with my mum and sis (2 rooms). I personally, adore the friendly staff, quirky rooms and the delicious breakfast every morning. Yes there were mistakes ; very slow service, many things were not stocked up and I had to call numerous times to remind them of things I'd requested but the manager did apologize and sent me up some lovely chocolates! Thank you :) Also service improved considerably thereafter. It was a truly relaxing few days of staycation. Mum was absolutely happy to just cosy up in bed while my sis and I went good hunting around as there really is splendid choices., what with the laksa at Roxy square right next door, chicken rice just 5 minutes away, awfully chocolate and of course, the",5
koba-sf,Very Convenient Location for Gourmet Tourists,"I would like to thank 2 staff at Indigo hotel Singapore - KC and Qi Qi who went that extra mile to help with the packing of my very large certificate frame for my onward flight.

joziboy,Beautiful hotel in beautiful neighborhood!,"The hotel has plenty of peranakan charm throughout, from the enamel painted mug to the spittoon on the floor I hadn’t seen since I was a kid, the hotel oozes charm throughout. The rooms are well appointed, very clean and had a lovely view of the East Coast Road area. There were a couple of downsides. The room sound insulation could be better. I kept getting woken by my Neighbour opening their luggage and banging it against the wall. The mirrors and plug points for the hair dryer are too far apart. You couldn’t use the hairdryer to style your hair properly in front of any of the mirrors. Minus one star for these faux pas. Check in staff were warm and accommodating and everything was smoothly arranged. A welcome drink would have been nice.",5
Ermil S,Enjoy a different view of Singapore,"Had an excellent stay there for 2 nights in May.. the room was clean, bed super comfortable and all the amenities you would think of were in the room.. coffee maker, tea, spa toiletries, comb, toothbrush, slippers. Breakfast at Baba Chews was delicious.. western and local offerings, and coffee made to order. Location in Katong was ideal.. lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance.Need transport to get into central downtown though. Best part of the stay was the wonderful staff, smiling faces, greetings at all times, and always ready to help out with anything. Thanks so much everyone for a wonderful stay, We will be back !",5
Leticia P,Great hotel experience,"I stayed Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong several times so far, and keep staying at here because of the location, location and location! If I go thrifty and not severely raining, I can take public bus route 36 from Changi airport to the closest bus stop in 30 minutes then several minutes to walk. Or it’s only 10-15 minutes of taxi ride, therefore the cost for taxi is less than half if I compare to the major hotels on Orchard Road. They are installing a new MRT (kind of subway) line on Marine Parade Road so if the MRT station is open in the near future, it’s even more convenient for sure. Also, when I go to Chinatown or Orchard Road, where the good restaurants and “Hawkers” as well as large shopping centers reside, closest bus stop is a block away and take a ride of the public bus",5
Two Grey nomads,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"We stayed here in June 2018 and absolutely loved it! The rooms were beautifully decorated with asian inspired furniture and art, The room was a bit small, but for Singapore standards, quite OK. The area was amazing - every restaurant on the main road looked incredible and worth a try. The staff of course were super. If you need to be in CBD, this is a bit out of the way, but if you have the flex or want to be closer to the airport, this is an amazing option. The fantastic east coast road hawker market is also very close.",5
Shilps17,A boutique hotel away from touristy areas,We spent 3 nights at this lovely recently built hotel. Room 1001 had great views of the city and a lovely circular bath where you could relax and enjoy the city views. Katong is one of Singapore’s historical precincts. It is 8.5 kms from downtown but closer to the airport. A cab to the city will cost around $10 Singapore and $19 to the airport. The staff are lovely and welcoming and helpful with information. It is situated in the Malay peranakan area which the cuisine reflects. There are lots of restaurants close by which are not expensive. Try the rooftop pool if you need to cool down. They provide an excellent breakfast and also have a nice bar and restaurant. The room price is reasonable for such lovely accommodation,5
Jagmohan W,Good Location,"Loved the rooms and the swimming pool. Very modern and quiet. The team was very kind and helpful. Good breakfast, good choices available. It is not really centered located but taxis are very easy to get.",5
Sarah C,Fantastic!,"This is an excellent boutique hotel. We had a one night stop over in this hotel. We only have good comments. It is located in Katong , an area just east of the city , with authentic shops , cafes etc , no upmarket shops , offices etc, but there other modern hotels in the area. It's only a few minutes walk down to a park and the sea. The room was clean , king size bed and quiet., staff very helpful Breakfast was good - for other meals we ate out locally. The shower has views across the area (with a curtain)! Our plane did not leave until midnight , and the hotel gave us a late checkout (8pm - at an acceptable extra price) which waa necessary for us in the Singapore weather. We have stayed in other Indigo hotels and recommend this hotel and others in the chain",5
Jason D,"Gorgeous, spacious room","This is a quiet boutique hotel, showcasing the local culture and heritage of Singapore and located in a more residential area. If you want to stay within close proximity of airport ( about 10-15 min drive by taxi) and get a sense of the ‘real’ Singapore and not the touristy one – this is the place. A number of good eateries around with a variety of food option, as well as two neighbourhood shopping malls just across the road. There is a bus stop with a few bus route connecting to the city center, however If you would like to take a train, then there isn’t a station at close walking distance. So if you want to stay in the hustle bustle this aint the place to be. However if you would like something quiet at a good value then this should definitely be your choice. Rooms are big",5
Robert W,Amazing,"Its approx. 10 kms. from Changi airport and hardly 50 metres from Katong Road, having near to 112 Katong Mall and several eating joints, including Indian, Chinese, Malay and Continental. Also about 1 km. walking from Sikh Temple at Wilkinsan Road. Not far for famous Jumbo and other Sea food restaurant, on the sea side.",5
Andreas Kaech,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here whilst visiting Singapore. And the hotel looks and is incredible. The rooms are designed to look like the old kampong homes. Which they duplicated perfectly. The rooms are a good size. There was only a few faults: • whilst having our room serviced, they didn't replace the toilet paper or coffee sachets. Which I then had to ask for. • we had a note through the door saying we had amenities. I then went and asked reception what it was and they said they would bring it to the room, I waited up for an hour and a half and it never arrives nor did it come for the rest of the stay. • some of the staff I didn't find to be helpful. If you were a premium member or guest I found you got treated better than us just staying there. It's a shame these I found to be faults as",4
Globetrotting_HKer,Nice room marred by renovation noise and very noisy guest,Stayed here for 3 nights to round out a south east Asia trip. Absolutely wonderful facility with helpful staff. After 6 weeks of travel we looked forward to a little more luxury and we definitely got it at the hotel Indigo. The breakfast was great and to be honest I really enjoyed the partial buffet style. Thanks!,5

Can only suggest you choose this hotel for your stay. We shall return for sure. Thanks to all staff for being so nice...",5
Malcolm_See,Great hotel with nice peranakan flavours,"Stayed here for one night during weekend on personal expense as an extension to a work trip in Singapore. The location is reasonably close to downtown although probably not ideal for first time tourists who want to spend lots of time exploring the main attractions (maybe someone who wants a quiet vacation enjoying local walks and food, or a small-business owner spending most time away from the hotel and just using it as a place to sleep would be suitable). Rooms are generously spacious for Singapore, with nice views of Katong, a beautiful rainshower, toilet on the small side, and very comfortable bedding. Staff was also courteous although some more helpful than others. Appreciated the thoughtful bits such as TWG tea, bottled water, and very nice toiletries. The breakfast was",5
GypsyJH_11,Great contemporary interpretation of tradition in luxe boutique hotel,"Great small hotel located at Katong Square a small boutique style hotel with quirky decor and nice swimming pool on roof 9th Floor with views over city. The hotel is in a good location for many eating and drinking places within the complex and also along the east coast road a short walk 2 minutes away. There is also a small shopping plaza directly on the next block along which has 6 screen cinema , Starbucks, small supermarket, lots of small boutique shops and a major Bank.

The biology toiletries were very good products. Walking trail to various heritage spot was included and we had a good time exploring the area. Food in the area was great too. Overall a very enjoyable stay",5
Raymond Y,Excellent staff,"Had an overall positive stay here on a staycation this week. Staff service was great and the decor and experience was refreshing, in fact, this is likely be one the few peranakan themed, top class hotels in the world. Check-in was pretty fuss free, with a welcome drink, iced coffee or tea provided. Layout was such that you had to pass by the reception area whenever you use the lift (which reminded me a little like fullerton bay hotel layout). Lift and lobby area were peranakan styled, and the room decorations were also chinese/malay style. As it was also my fiancee's birthday the day before, the hotel receptionist noticed that on check in, and had room service prepared a cake (pandan-flavoured), along with a card for her during the turndown service, which was really thoughtful.",5
Jen A,Wonderful hotel!,This is a really funky and luxurious hotel in a nice heritage area. The unique decor puts it in a class of its own and the staff are very welcoming. I was only there on an overnight stopover so didn't get to check out the breakfast or pool. Comfortable bed and spotlessly clean. Closer to the airport than the city hotels but probably not so convenient for sightseeing. I'm keen to go back for longer sometime.,5
Viajantes-75,Great design hotel,"I'm so glad I chose this hotel to stay at for our anniversary. It is located a short 10-15 min trip via taxi away from the airport, so once we got our luggage, we were literally walking in to the reception area before we knew it. All the staff were polite and friendly, willing to answer our questions about the best place to locally buy sim cards and MRT passes. The decor is beautiful, vibrant and colourful, so lovely. Our room was on the 15th floor, looking north over suburban Singapore- my tip, get a room with a bath and have a sneaky night time bath or two, it is magical. The amenities and soaps etc were great. We found our pillows too soft, it was no problem to have firmer ones found for us. The hotel location is not near an MRT station (yet) but there are a couple of bus",5
Nina Fevriena,Short Staycation,"Not many hotels offer such warm personal service, was pleasantly surprised by the warm smiles and attentive service at the front desk, as well as at the attached Baba Chiew restaurant, at which I ate dinner on two consecutive nights. One of the restaurant staff even addressed me by name, without me telling him what it was. He apparently found out and made an effort to remember it. The room itself was very clean and the air conditioning was strong. The decorations and ambience had a strong local character, which will appeal to the local and foreign traveller alike. I like the wooden flooring in the room, which meant that it could be properly cleaned, and I gave myself permission to go around barefoot as I would in my own house. I am always a little suspicious of fully-carpeted",4
hanumaniloilo,A Weekend in a Tropical Villa,"We only stayed for 1 night, but thought the hotel and staff were wonderful. The room itself was great and very cute. I loved all the artistic details throughout the room (like the mural on the wall, and the detailing on the tub). They use Biology travel size items and gave plenty of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and even bath salts. The room came with a phone that you could take with you when you went out. It was amazing to be site-seeing and able to see exactly what restaurants were nearby and find reviews. If the weather is nice I highly recommend going up to the pool. It's got a good view (not of the bay, but of neighborhoods), and a nice infinity pool. The hotel itself is a bit farther away from the Marina Bay area if you're planning on site-seeing. But, public",5
Jason L,Exemplary service; a property with lots of character.,"The room, which was spacious with a separate lounge area, and the communal areas were beautifully styled with great attention to detail. There is a rooftop pool which is pleasant. There are many places to eat in the neighbourhood and recommendations made by the hotel staff were excellent. There is no MRT nearby so taxis are the best way to get around. Would definitely return.",5

Special mentioned to Ms Yvonne who is exceptionally patience when dealing with a demanding guest like myself (haha) from day 1. Her sincerity and professionalism in ensuring my stay went well is very well appreciated, look out for her on your next visit, she will not disappoint you. I wld also like to mentioned the front office staffs (named,OK & another male Indian gentleman) who made the check-in smooth going. Breakfast in Baba Chew's was cosy, thank you Mike. Overall, I will be back, definitely!!! Keep up the good work Hotel Indigo. You hve an excellent people with you.",5
yklloyd,Great stay!,"I recently had a two night stay at Indigo Katong and was not disappointed. The room was comfortable with quirky but we'll thought of details: the toilet is separate right by the entrance while the bath is across by the window with a lounge chair and a side table with a retro enamel tin foot spa set. The toiletries had the distinct scent of lemongrass which complimented the running theme of patterned tiles and wood floors. The coffee and tea plus the fridge we're set in a retro glass cabinet. It was like a weekend at a tropical villa. I would visit again. Thank you, Indigo",5

MatthewBrooker,Weekend getaway,"Stayed 3days/2nights and really enjoyed our stay. My wife loved the design of the room, I found that a little too much was happening at the same time, but hey - it was fine. The rooftop pool was nice and had a fantastic view. Not that many sun loungers, but since it was quite windy when we visited, it newer got crowded. The Breakfast was great. I really like the combination of ""made to order"" items and buffet. High quality and really delicious ! Many small and cosy restaurants just outside the hotel and easy access to Singapore citycenter by public busses. (bus stop 250m from the hotel)",5
Josh A,The Bee’s Knee’s,"Booked a weekend staycation at Hotel Indigo as a bday celebration for my bf. Upon checked in,the front staff was very warm and receptive, and provided a detailed check in guide. As I have informed the hotel earlier that it was a staff celebration, Esther helped to arrange for a complimentary cake to be delivered to our room and Yvonne wrote a personalized bday card and arranged for the bed to be decorated with origami butterflies. It was very much a pleasant surprise and gesture indeed. Much appreciated. We also really enjoyed the cosiness of the room as it brought us back to the olden days. Room was very clean and spacious too. Overall it was a great stay and I will definitely come back if theres a chance to.",5
TinoBest,Excellent boutique hotel,"We stayed here for just 1 night to cap off our 2-week Asia trip. It was a great stay. The rooms are very unique and look as good in person compared to the photos online. The area is very vibrant, with lots of choices for dining and shopping. We wish the stay was longer...and will look to revisit Singapore in the future. The Hotel Indigo is a fine choice for lodging and I can highly recommend it.",5
Fiona N,Wonderful hotel at east side of Singapore,"Very pleasant hotel. New, spotless, and reasonably priced. The rooms have a funky modern design - not for everyone and personally I prefer a more traditional look, but it was very comfortable. Service was very polite and attentive. No negatives. Location is convenient for the airport but also close to shopping centres and some tourist spots - there is a famous laksa restaurant almost opposite that is plastered with photos of the great and good (many Hong Kong film stars, and Gordon Ramsay among them) who have eaten there. The hotel is also only about 5-10 minutes walk from the East Coast park, which is a fantastic place to run.",5

I will definitely be returning to stay again.",4
Lawrence C,A unique yet beautiful hotel,"Decent sized rooms, decor and fittings are very stylish (a nod to the Peranakan culture of the area). The location is about half way between the CBD and airport (but this was the reason we chose to stay here - straight down the ECP from the airport and less hectic and quieter than the CBD so good for a decent nights sleep. Next door to a shopping mall (112 Katong) and only a 10 minute walk from the much larger Parkway parade mall. LOTS of places to eat in front of the hotel itself and you are only a 15 min taxi ride from the city centre. Staff helpful at check in; offered a welcome drink which was a nice touch having just come off a 12hr flight from Europe.",5
willyf7,"Stayed there twice, will be back soon","We booked the premier room with bath tub and view which is the creme de la creme of the hotel. It provides a good view of the east side of Singapore with lots of old shophouses while ur soaking in the bath tub. Wish the room size could be bigger, the entrance with wardrobes and bathroom side by side is slightly too narrow. The hotel itself is right next to 2 malls and lots of restaurants in the alleys. U can also chill at the siting area near to the lobby or the bar or bistros next to the hotel. Infinity Pool at the rooftop is nice for taking pics. But there's no kids or baby pool. So we just have a quick dip. The breakfast was semi buffet style, selection was limited. Taste was ok. Restaurant and front desk staffs are always greeting us with smiles when they see us. Only down",5
Jools,A Lovely Experience,"Situated just 15 mins from the Airport this is a nice choice for any visitor to Singapore. Located in Katong this stylish boutique hotel incorporates the best of the area in its design. We were very pleased with our Premier Room with Bath situated on the 14th Floor. Obviously the design and style attracted me to the hotel but the in-room comfort was outstanding. Very good quality tea, Nespresso or filter coffee provided. Local sweets also offered complimentary! Plenty of bottled water provided free and a host of good quality toiletries. Bed and pillows very very comfortable!! The ‘welcome’ dessert provided was a nice touch and very tasty, as were the daily pralines left on your bed. Only one minor downside of our room was the sound of the adjacent room waste water run off...",5
Adrie L,Beautifully decorated,"I am totally in love with this hotel. The decor & ambience are fabulous with lots of local characters. Room is a mixture of ultra modern & old heritage.

Kimberleemcpike,Quirky and fun,"I love ambience, places that don't follow a model of chain accommodation, and the decor of Hotel Indigo aims to please, and so it did. Such lovely touches... the foot basin, elixer and moisturiser after a day of walking around Gardens by the Bay was so welcome for tired swollen feet. The fruit basket, the tasty local lollies... complimentary water, on top of superb friendly service at check in (and check out), firmly puts Indigo Hotels in other places of interest going forward. Oh, and a great local neighbourhood to explore.",5
Jackie D,Great design,"We were hesitant to book this hotel as it cost more than the other hotels around the area of Katong. We gave it a go anyways, hoping that it will be monies well spend on a long planned holiday and boy, were glad that we did. We stayed here for 3 nights and have thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Hotel is situated in Katong, and is closed to almost every where in Singapore. Hotel lobby was beautifully decorated. Staff at check in was polite. Had a welcome drink of ice latte. Hotel has a peranakan theme and was reflected entirely in the decorations throughout hotel, corridors and rooms. The room was clean. We slept wonderfully for the 3 nights. Can't comment on the rest as we did not use other facilities.",5
Grace C,"Amazing aesthetics, great location for food and value for money!","I am solo business / conference travelling with a week in Singapore. This is my first time here, or in any of that marque, and I am impressed. Most everything is quite compact and careful but it does not convey cheap-and-nasty, not one bit. The entry façade is understated but obvious the second time round. The lobby is bright, cheery, and meticulously clean and decorated. My early-morning reception staffer (06:00 arrival) was cheery and courteous and able to provide me a top-floor room, and check me in, at that dreadful hour. Two quiet lifts services the residential (and roof) floors from the lobby area. My room, again, was compact and felt uncluttered and luxurious. I later realized that I was directly and immediately underneath the rooftop swimming pool. The room setup was a",5
Son Nie,Unique Baba-Nyonya designed hotel,"I like these hotels for several reasons. 1. They aren’t cookie cutter designs; pretty funky representation of the Singapore style. 2. Excellent customer service. 3. Lovely beds and thoughtful touches (foot bath gear!). The attached restaurant is, however, expensive. The neighborhood is an historic one with a colorful past. Good walking and a nearby temple.",5
luxmousewong,Lovely staff,"We don't often stay at major chain hotels but were very pleasantly surprised by how quirky and well designed this hotel is. It is located right next door to another IHG hotel - The Holiday Inn, but the Indigo brand has individually styled hotels and this one is very nicely decorated to reflect the Peranakan culture of Katong. The room itself was well laid out and comfortable. Breakfast was ok but nothing special and there are lots of options to have breakfast around the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful and able to provide lots of information and advice. There is a beautiful rooftop pool with great views.",4
globetrotters808,One of my favorite IHG hotels in Singapore so far...,"This hotel is an absolute delight to stay in! I got the room with the bath tub. Honestly I was very blown away by the decor and overall aesthetics!!! Very Peranakan/Singapore with a stylish modern twist that is such a visual feast. There were mini games in the room as well that kept us entertained every now and then. Also, tons of famous popular food all around the hotel area, which is wonderful!! I think for the $$ you pay per night, this is one of the best deals you can get.",5
Villaraco,I want to go back!,"Cleanliness - excellent, 5-star rated Location - ok, was near to the place of my meeting, not far from city center Price - reasonable Staff - friendly, always smiling and very helpful Facilities - free wifi, did not have time to enjoy the pool Breakfast - included ala cart breakfast which is nice Others - the baba-nyonya design makes it look like a boutique hotel, which is very welcoming Will definitely stay here in my next trip.",5
Grace K,Will definitely come back!,"Stayed here for a short weekend stay and I am very happy with the overall service received. Staff was very sharp and friendly, which is not always the case in this city. Check in was smooth and my room had all someone could ask for. Location is good and easy to find cabs nearby! Solid hotel and would come back for sure!",5
MacVan M,What a find!,"I am a Spire Elite member of IHG Rewards Club and while knowingly realize for years that IHG have a indie hotel brand by the name of Indigo, this is my first time decided to try one out and the choice falls onto a rather new Indigo Singaproe Katong. So I stayed in Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong between March 10-12th 2018 during a business and leisure trip over the weekend. The hotel, while rather new, it also offer a fresh approach for an upscale city hotel should be; artsy, bold, true to the heritage of its environment. Upon entering the property, the scent and aura of Peranakan era of Singapore old past welcome me and immediately the quirks (good ones) of the brand stands out. I immediately feel at home. Even the cups and loose furniture is from the old Melayu Peranakan period",5
Janeywworld,Chic hotel,"Singapore was the first stop on a big trip through Asia and te Indigo Katong was what I needed to start with the right foot. The hotel is simply amazing. Personnel is great, location is great, views are great, the pool is fantastic and really quiet and the rooms are beautiful and clean. It is not near quite in downtown but is not needed. The Katong area is full of places to eat and a cab downtown will cost you around 20 SGD. One COOL thing about the hotel is that the rooms come with a smartphone with internet that you can take around the city. How cool is that!!?",5
Ewa J,Bathroom with a view,"This is my first time staying in Katong area (despite the numerous amount of times I’ve been to Singapore). Was recommended due to the food around. The hotel is located righty next to 112 mall, the mall isn’t big, but there’s groceries mart, watson etc. no MRT station (under construction behind the hotel). Bus station is nearby. The hotel itself is nice. A lot of people lot their way to holiday inn as they are sister-company. Ambiance, terrific. The staff are very Hospitable, kind & attentive. Check in was fast! I got the deluxe room at the 13th floor. Room was clean (not carpeted but still clean). Shower are is separated with the lavatory. The window is at the shower area, so no window right beside you bed(it’s a door to the shower area). The pool is a nice infinity",5
FrequentTraveller153,An interesting visit to Singapore,"Comfortable, very stylish decor, excellent service. The roof top pool has breathtaking views. Located in an authentic neighbourhood, about 15-20 minutes bus ride to the CBD but we think much nicer than staying in the CBD. Excellent restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity. Special touch with the foot bath/soak provided in the room, and best of all the free smart phone for your use - a great help navigating the area with Google maps and booking tickets to attractions. We had a problem with our Singapore Zoo tickets and the hotel staff sorted everything out for us, including a refund for an accidental double booking. Big thumbs up!",5

JeremyLeong,Wonderful Birthday Staycation!,"Stayed in Indigo Hotel in Katong; an old part of the city. Interesting place with a choice of restaurants. Sadly, many taxi drivers appeared not to know Katong. Also went during Chinese New Year and consequently taxis were difficult to gt hold of. Had to use public buses after great help from locals. Best part of Singapore: Garden by the Bay. Worst: Shopping - extremely expensive if you are visitor from Europe - in fact from anywhere.",4
Valerie D,Great hotel and interesting suburb,"Had a staycation here in the room with the bathtub. The room is nicely decorated with a traditional nonya vibe. The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious and for travellers, it is recommended to try some local delicacies from the restaurant. The breakfast options were sufficient and the food served was good. The room also served some jars of local sweets which were complimentary. Would highly recommend this hotel! :)",5
Siti A,"Great thoughtful service, beautiful facilities","My wife and I stayed at hotel indigo for a three night stop over from Sydney to England. The hotel was perfectly positioned close to the city but a quieter and more traditional area, so best of both worlds. The rooms were spotless, with excellent decor, lovely comfy beds, exactly what we needed. The breakfasts were lovely, staff were happy and really helpful, the roof top infinity pool was amazing. I would totally recommend this hotel to any one and we wished we could have stayed longer ! We will definitely be going back ! Spot on Hotel Indigo 👍🏻",5
Foxy042,Excellent hotel in great location close to airport,"i booked for my wife's birthday staycation during 24-26 Feb and it was one of the best staycation we ever had. Although there are some minor delays upon checking in, the staff is friendly and welcoming and even extend a late check out for us. Special thanks to Esther for her friendly, attentiveness and warm services rendered to us. We love the room with the bathtub, everything is so unique with the Peranakan theme. The view facing the city area and surrounding Katong area were nice and warm! The staff even surprised my wife with a slice of birthday cake delivered to our room. Breakfast was served at Baba's Chew and it was excellent. Service was good with the staff explaining the choice of breakfast and their special of the day.

lga311,Most Luxurious Stay of our Trip,"After reading a review in the Sydney Morning Herald, we decided to stay at Hotel Indigo, Katong. We did not regret our decision. The bedrooms, pool area, gym are as nice as they appear in the photos. The view from the pool is amazing. Breakfasts are delicious with a wide range of foods. I liked the interior design. The suburb itself is very interesting to discover, with its colourful small houses. We arrived after midnight at the airport and only paid S$22 for the ride. From Katong it is also easy to catch a bus to go into town.",5

The layout of the room, is well thought out, with generous bathroom amenities provided. The customer service is consistently great no matter which staff is serving you, a rare find in Singapore. The rooftop pool, although slightly small, is big enough for you to do laps, and offers a picturesque view anytime of the day. The gym is well equipped too! And did I mention the bed and pillows? Oh so soft, and cooling, you would just want to sleep on it right away. The room service is excellent, with food that is delicious and offers local cuisine (important if one suddenly craves to have",5
Vincentchew4059,Hotel with a sense of nostalgia,"What a find in Singapore. A quirky, boutique hotel close to the airport but in a very interesting area. And it's reasonable value especially if you are an IHG member. The Katong area has colourful terraces and a number of bars and restaurants to choose from. The decor is very different, but great, and the view from our room through the full end wall of window was stunning. The infinity pool at the top has an even better panoramic view. The staff were very helpful and friendly.",5
xksb,Katong Wonder,"We stayed two night at the Hotel Indigo in Singapore in December 2017, bridging a two week stay in Thailand and a cruise departing Singapore. Staying here was one of the true highlights of our trip. Our room was well decorated with local touches, like a metal foot bath and soaking salts, an umbrella, slippers and robes, and local decor. The room even came equipped with a local cell phone you could take with you during the day! The sheets were the most luxurious I recall in a hotel. And the staff was friendly and accommodating. The location is good, near public busses and in an interesting area to walk. Although this was the most expensive accommodation of our trip, it was quite reasonably priced for Singapore. Quietly simply, we loved everything about Singapore, and",5
Sameera K,SG paradise,"The check in was one of the best I have seen for a long time. Excellent, the lady from Korea was extremely helpful. A very god business card for the Hotel. The rooms are very well decorated. The Hotel is very closed to the action in Katong. The only disadvantage is you can hear people moving above you, or the draining of the bath tub. Breakfast is quite good with a lot of option. But for people who like to have there breakfast outside, there are plenty of option, all within short walking distances.",5
Saufboy,"very good hotel and location, will defiantly stay again.","Hotel Indigo Singapore is a unique boutique hotel located in Katong. I like the room decoration as it is weaved with elements of Peranakan culture, with everything from the arts murals to the wall tiles. It is a great way for tourists to experience the Singapore heritage at Hotel Indigo like the locals here. You should explore the rich heritage of Katong within walking distance from the hotel. If you wish to shop, there are two shopping malls beside the hotel within very short walking distance (five minutes). The deluxe room is huge and clean and has a vibrant composition of modern peranakan design. The room decoration is beautiful and good for Instagram post. Check out the painted wall! Try to select room on the high floor and facing the city for a magnificent view. The room",5
TP,"Great hotel, good service & attentive/helpful staff","Hotel Indigo Katong is a thoughtfully designed hotel which I highly recommend if you want to stay near the airport or east side of Singapore. This hotel is not minimalist, but it’s also not over designed. I appreciate many things offered by the hotel - android smartphone with data plan, traditional Chinese candies, speedy wifi, Nespresso coffee, breakfast spread, infinity pool, and awesome views. But what I loved the most is their staff and excellent customer service. Special thanks to Kha Ying who ensured a speedy checkout (under 30 secs) and called the restaurant to arrange a coffee to go at 6.15am when the restaurant doesn’t open until 6.30. All of the staff I encountered were all smiles - from reception to the cleaning staff. I felt very welcomed and loved every minute",4

rhythm,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights, the cab ride from the airport was $20 max and took 15 mins, whilst staying here we used public transport which was very clean and frequent, if you turn left out of the hotel and 200m down the road there is a 7-eleven where you get the card to use buses/MRT, we used it for 3 days and the cost was around £7 so dont load the card up with too much money as its very cheap to get around, bus stop for orchard rd is by the 7-eleven and get the 14 bus, takes around 20 mins, use the free phone in the room for maps etc. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted very well with a free welcome drink and fast service, we added late check out until 7pm for around $100 as our flight was at midnight home, we were offered help with our baggage from the taxi to the room,",5

There is no porter available at night so if you have a lot of luggage you will be doing transporting it yourself! The room itself is quite spacious and cleverly planned, my wife enjoyed the quirkiness of the room and indeed the room was quite unique. The breakfast was really enjoyable with a semi buffet which was a welcome change from the standard buffet breakfast. Overall enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will highly recommend it.",5
Fikoukla,Loved this cool well-positioned hotel,"It is a great way to experience the Singapore heritage at Hotel Indigo. Being a Singaporean, I find the deco and design authentic and nostalgic. We were there for a night on staycation. It was a great experience. Since many reviews have shared their photos of the beautiful room, I have decided to share on different things. Things I will look out for as a traveller. So here are what I like about this hotel. 1. You will like the toiletries if you like the scent if lemongrass. The quality are quite good, not harsh on the skin or hair. Besides bath gel and shampoo (which are quite standard), they also provide conditioner, which is an essential for woman with longer hair. 2. The hair dryer is powerful. It is a little heavy, but dries your hair really fast. I love it because it",5

Célia D,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff.","""Arresting funky design"" can be code for a visual headache concocted by someone who shouldn't be allowed near the colour charts. But fear not, this hotel has a distinctive look and vibe, but it's really works and it's a refreshing change from the bland minimalism boutique design hotels so often adopt. It's a modern hotel in a traditional neighbourhood. The rooms are generously sized, and I loved their retro touches, e.g. the traditional enamel bowl laid out ready to have a foot bath. Everything was well thought through, and (importantly) modern where it needed to be, e.g. the bathroom. I didn't have time to use the pool sadly as it looked stunning. The neighbourhood is close to the pretty Joo Chat road with it's wonderful multicoloured shop houses. But don't expect that to be a",5

Gunduz GUNES,All Photos are same as in the websites and Free handy telephone,We stayed in Hotel Indigo for 2 nights and were very impressed by everything. The room is beautiful and the staff even decorated it for our honeymoon. They were fantastic and very helpful as we were a little stressed on arrival having no luggage and an airline who had no idea where our luggage was (Malaysian Airlines). The view from the room was great and the shower faced out towards the view. Everything in the room had been designed in the Peranakan style (I think that's what it was called). It was really beautiful and so tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable and we got very good and peaceful night's sleep. Everything was great and we would definitely come again.,5

Terribly confused I went up to my room. A very small room but cosily arranged, with a comfortable bed. Toilet and bathroom were separate, a very nice thought. The not so good part was the visibility from outside the bathroom, but shielded with curtains. Restaurant was a bar as well. As usual that was a bit a forte for this hotel within the group. They have an agenda to downplay the services and F&B section. That's what is wondering me. Even a shaving kit or a comb is not provided by default but made to ask them. A cheap mentality of savings proposed perhaps within their organization. Otherwise the hotel is safe and in a nice place. They",5

Very nice and well decorated Peranakan themed rooms; spacious, well utilized spaces and beautiful design. Room is clean and housekeeping did a fantastic job each night replacing our toiletries and etc. My only feedback is about the drainage at the shower, tend to make a lot of noise after a shower but the noise dies off after awhile so not a problem eventually. The foot soak and scrub was truly enjoyable and toiletries of superb quality. Don't forget to check out Infinity pool at the roof top floor.. great view!

The decor beautifully reflected the peranakan neighbourhood where it is situated. The staff are charming and helpful. The complimentary mobile phone for the duration of the stay took us by surprise and is a stroke of genius! The charming room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with little nostalgic touches of wooden clogs, chamber pot and candies from older times. Whilst it is not near a MRT station, buses into orchard road are easily available. There are plenty of eateries near and around the hotel.

The room was a good size, and was a Japanese style, with a sliding divider between the bedroom and bathroom. The hotel has a nice infinity pool on the roof as well as a gym. The restaurant for breakfast and dinner, was small but nice and the staff were very helpful. Based in Katong, it was also nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the Orchard Road area, with more authentic local shops and restaurants. Overall a very good expeirince, and I will",5
Jzin2010,Most excellent!,"Rooms in excellent condition as it is still a new property. They have all the amenities you'll need for a comfortable stay and an excellent Front Desk Team to boot. My compliments to Mehvish for such a personable check-in that does not feel mechanical. The room allows in natural sunlight in the day but at night the room can be a tad bit dim for some. Nonetheless it induces bedtime mood. I'd recommend this property for couples or friends. The re-stay value is low unless you are a frequent visitor of Singapore and know your way around. The pool is less impressive than the gym setup but then again, such is the Indigo series. More about the room setup and pricing than luxurious facilities.",5
893Sandra,Funky hotel,"Booked this for our 1st wedding anniversary staycay. The Peranakan décor is lovely and the service is excellent! Check-in was smooth. We also appreciated the little gestures like the cake, pralines and love swans. The rooms are spacious! The view was excellent! The décor brings back some nostalgia. There's a free carom board for you to play. TV had movie channels and mini bar had free tea and coffee. Good layout in separating the washroom area from the shower area and yes, we had booked the biggest room with the bathtub. It's relatively quiet and since we seldom hang out at Katong, we explored the area a little bit. Rows of cafes and restaurants along the road and you can take your pick. A bus ride away from the city area too. Breakfast was decent, wait staff was fine.",5

The hotel was immaculate and in a really central part of Katong in Singapore. The decor of the hotel and rooms were Peranakan which was absolutely beautiful. The rooftop infinity pool and area was perfect for relaxing and having a drink particularly as the sun went down. The staff were all friendly and helpful. It is close by the beach gardens, shopping malls, transport and lots of lovely restaurants.",4

The staff are clearly a lot more experienced, this is a credit to this hotel chain to see the improvement in the staff over the course of our 2 stays. The room was perfect, clean and comfortable. The location is perfect if you don't mind being out of the CBD. There are many bus options at either the front or back of the hotel to take you to the main attractions and places to visit in Singapore. Before too long the train will also service this area. Would definitely stay again when next in Singapore.",5

Located in a buzzing part of town, this hotel offers decent size room, clean, nicely decorated for a reasonable price.

Previously we had stayed at the iconic hotel there but wanted a broader experience of Singapore. The Indigo was just what we wanted. It has a relaxed feel, excellent decorations to make you interested in the environment, but the stars of this hotel are the great team of staff. Excellent, helpful and friendly they all helped us with queries we had, solved difficulties and offered advice. We were a little way out in Katong but local transport is cheap and easy. The Handy telephone also meant we got discounts to two attractions. We would definitely stay here again, and will probably look for other hotels of this brand.",5

The staff are very helpful, specially to mention one of the front desk staff Ms Melanie, your personal touched have added colours to our short staycation.

Strongly recommended and will definitely be back again. Thanks guys",5
Keran M,Stand out hotel,"This hotel is beautiful; it's a shame that the customer service is among the worst I have ever experienced. I was to receive a parcel during my stay, and asked hotel staff before I arranged for shipment whether they would accept the parcel. They said yes, so I had it shipped. Upon checkout, I still hadn't received the parcel--turns out they rejected the shipment because of what I later learned was supposedly ""hotel policy."" I was traveling out of the country, and the courier could not ship it outside of Singapore, so I tried to make arrangements with the hotel. Coordinating with this hotel after the fact was a colossal waste of time. They took over two weeks to respond to communications and eventually stopped responding. I then contacted IHG, who said they would have the hotel",5
Seza3,What a view!,So cool room interior. Very good Internet speed in the room. The swimming pool is something that you MUST NOT miss. The breakfast is one of the best that I have ever had. The location is very convenient. And of course the staff is so kind.,5
Akash M,Every penny worth of new breed of luxury,"This may well be my hotel of choice in all my Singapore stopovers from now on. It is a gorgeous place with its stylish Peranakan decor, wonderful service, convenient location close to the airport in the interesting neighbourhood of Katong and terrific rooftop pool with a view over a wide area of the city. The room itself has so many lovely little extra touches that I would have been happy just to have relaxed there for my whole visit. The restaurant staff in Baba Chew's could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Very highly recommended.",5
Mr Muhd,The Best Hotel,"I’ve stayed in over 20 hotels this year & I have to say Hotel Indigo is right up there at the top. From the moment you walk in and are greeted by the awesome staff, to the moment you exit, it’s an experience. A fun, modern hotel with real character, in the heart of old Singapore, Hotel Katong is a Hotel others should look to emulate. Is it perfect? Well, no. There are still too many “led” lights at night and you can hear the TV from next door - but really that’s it for complaints. Our room was a twin double - perfect size for a family of four for a night. Great views from the room and the roof top pool. The mini bar is cool and the room has a Nespresso machine for morning coffee. Bar Chews restaurant was great for breakfast but for dinner I recommend going out, the street is",5
Ouyang85,Full marks,"We stayed here for the nights before moving onto Bali. What can I say? The service from the moment we stepped into reception was exceptional. Friendly and helpful and someone there whenever we walked past. They booked taxis for us, booked a table at a Marina Bay Sands restaurant for us, and printed documents for us. After working out the lift (scan room key then press floor number, we got to our room. The decor is amazing/unique. We chose a room with a bathtub in it, and I'm so glad we did. The view from the 13th floor was beautiful, and at night from the bathtub was just brilliant. There was a toilet, two sinks and a rainfall shower. There was also plenty of shower gel/lotion available. The in-room tea and coffee facilities were good, with choice of teas, filter coffee,",4
WeiRong_K,Amazing Staycation!,"Situated in the beautiful neighbourhood of Katong, the hotel will surely surprise with its offerings. Although having read good reviews about the hotel, we were still a bit skeptical about booking the King room with view & bath. But only upon arrival we realised, that how good the place is. The hotel provides so much more to relish and enjoy that you'll find it really hard to go site seeing. A bathtub, right in the room overlooking the colorful roofs of Katong's houses and complexes. For swimming enthusiasts, the hotel has one of best Infiniti pools I have come across in hotels with similar budget. Then the colorful and beautiful lobby with few books and couple of iMacs surely is so lively and fresh. The room is vibrant. Coffee bar has several flavors of complementary coffee.",5
Clumsygorilla,Beautiful Rooms,"Stayed for 1 night to celebrate a birthday but wished we could stay for more nights. Clean rooms,amazing shower area. Nice view from room. Comfortable bed. Great rooftop pool. Near to shopping malls and restaurants and bars along joo chiat area. For muslims, theres cheap Halal nasi padang stall just across the road, 5min walk. Theres 24hrs shop opposite the road and a 7-11 along the street of the hotel. Definately worth the visit.",5
FerrisXL,Peranakan hotel in Katong,"Second time staying, and this is now my go to hotel when on business in Singapore. Really funky boutique feel, comfortable rooms, adequate gym equipment and a nice breakfast with friendly staff. They do well with the small touches too: welcome chocolates in the room, local candies from yesteryear and an Epsom salt foot bath pan at your disposal.",5
EddeeDy,Absolutely IG worthy!,"Booked a Premier Room with Bathtub for a weekend staycation. Was amazed by this seemingly small hotel. It has a breathtaking infinity pool with an awesome view of the neighbourhood. View from the pool was not blocked by any building! The room was great, design was unique with furniture and amenities that suits the theme of the hotel. A carrom table and a set of carrom was also included! Too bad the surface was not exactly very smooth for a proper round of carrom, but well we did had fun playing the game. The bathtub was huge and the view from the bathroom was superb too! It had a separate rain shower at the corner too. Space in the room was intelligently utilized! Oh, wine glasses were also provided! It would be even better if the mini bar drinks were complimentary too! :) All",5
Baldwin_Mr,Good deal,"Stayed in a room with tub, it was such a beautifully decorated room and my wife and kids loved it! The decor is so retro and we especially loved the tub. Got the hotel to arrange something for the Wife as it was her birthday and wasn't disappointed, just a little hiccup, hotel promised one of the balloons will have a Happy Birthday but turns out all were plain balloons. (Disclaimer: Arrangements were chargeable so I'm not being a cheapskate ;-)) Breakfast was a little disappointing though the Baba Cafe had a very nice atmosphere and decor and the semi buffet presentation was very nice. However, the main courses served was rather disappointing - porridge was rather bland, carrot cake was quite over fried, laksa was so so. However, the presentation of the food helped to",5
Kim C,Perfect to see Katong,"Liked: - Design and theme of the hotel- Peranakan and at the same time modern. - Good condition of furniture and amenities- hotel is still new - Friendliness of staff - Location- right next to Katong I12 - Rooftop Pool with great views over Katong -Breakfast- semi-buffet with a good spread - Free standing bathtub in room - Nespresso machine in room Points for improvement: - When the room was made up, a refill of tea bags, coffee and/or milk was forgotten at several occasions. - Limited space for luggage - Too few places to hang things in the room, such as wet towels or washbags.",5
JacqFung,Good hotel with value price,"Celebrated one of my best friends birthday and decided to check out Hotel Indigo Katong! It was worth it! The staffs were friendly and so genuine in their services as they explained about the hotel and you can asked them about their recommendations and stuffs. We were introduced to Joanne during our check in and Hidayah during our check out. Both ladies were professional and served us with smiles and showed their genuine interest regarding our stay and their hotel facilities. Since it was my friend's birthday, they surprised us with a cake after we came back from our swim! What a sweet and nice gestures! Oh! The hotel is also located at the premises of food and shopping mall! You will be so spoiled with choices! And lastly, the breakfast spread at their Baba Chews is so",5
osheaclaire1,I would 100% recommend staying at this unique hotel,"This is a hotel with a very trendy / cool vibe. The decor is really good, I liked the unique design of the bedroom. The Swimming pool and 24 hour gym are definitely highlights. There are plenty of good restaurants near the hotel.",5
Raul G,nice hotel and excellent service,"we normally stay in or around little India or chinatown and I much preferred this location for the surrounding areas when you only have a day stop over. great hotel, clean and very comfortable, would highly recommend",5
Fearrow,Best Themed Hotel stay!,"I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel on 2 Sept. for business. This was my 2nd time I chose this hotel. Not only is the unique theme of the hotel, cleanliness of room and bedding are my most concern. I was impressed by the reservation team for their quick replied email on my request change check-in-date one day earlier. Also, front desk staffs and housekeeping crews are very nice and polite. They are very professional and very welcoming. Though hotel location is not near MRT, it’s very convenient to get a bus or cheap taxi ride from hotel to other places. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and well-priced. Definitely, Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong is the first choice for next visit.",4
Carole D,"Good little hotel, plenty to see and do","I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 night stay there a few days ago. The staff are a credit to the hotel, both front office staff and restaurant staff were so friendly and nothing was too much bother. The room was clean and the shower view was amazing :-)...the little added extras (chocolate on my bed, free sweets in cabinet, foot bath etc) added to the ambiance of the hotel. The roof top pool was spotlessly clean and great view of the area as was the gym. I also realised the day after my departure that I had left my wallet in the hotel safe, I called the hotel and Yvonne looked into it for me, called me back within 10 minutes to confirm my wallet was there and arranged for me to pick it up - thank you Yvonne for your prompt dealing with this and a huge thank you to the hotel housekeeping",5
wysely,Unique Peranakan-style boutique hotel,"The hotel reception and rooms are very nice and clean. the staff are very helpful and friendly. the only negative think I can say is that the smoking area is in the terrace, considering the weather in singapore, smoking outside is a nightmare because you start sweating too much. there should be an air conditioned smoking área.",5
SingLai,"Nice Hotel Entrance, Delayed Check-in, Great Room, Lousy Breakfast","We stayed for one night at this hotel without any expectation. We were pleasantly surprised by the unique theme of the hotel, which is Peranakan style and the interior stays true to the theme. We had a fast check-in, the staff was polite and quickly ease us in to our room which had the Katong neighbourhood view. The room itself was colourful, clean and well-equipped with the necessities. For a coffee lover, we loved that they even provide coffee plunger with coffee powder for us to enjoy a cup of hot coffee in the morning. The infinity pool was decent too with a view of the neighbourhood. Overall, we would stay here again!",5
John8394927,Worst service ever,"We recently stayed at the hotel for four nights in a premium king room. The room was really spacious, well set up, clean, light and great amenities. The reception area was spacious, very bright, clean and colourful. Check in staff were friendly and very helpful. The Peranakan touches throughout the hotel were lovely and made for a special stay. The rooftop pool was a good size and afforded a great view. There was always plenty of towels on offer. Breakfast was included in the cost and there was plenty of food and variety on offer. Service was good. We arrived about 3 hours early and were able to check on arrival which was appreciated. The location is great, with plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance and well priced. We did find housekeeping services",5
NaniSG,Fantastic and quaint!,"My GF and I stayed here for a one-night staycation on 1 September 2017. Although the check-in time was set a little late, at 3pm, the process was smooth and fast, and the reception staff (Joanne) was very polite. I was served a welcome drink while I waited for a brief moment for the checking-in to be done. When I reported that the key card wasn't able to open the room door, Joanne personally went up with me to ensure that the new key card worked. My GF and I also received a complimentary special heart-shaped cake when the hotel realized it was our romantic getaway. We were delighted by the interior decor of the room. A mix of peranakan elements and old Katong flavors. Yet the amenities were modern and stylish. The room was large enough to accommodate a cozy corner with a small",5
Billowingflag,Great place to stay,"As one of the previous reviewer mentioned, the check-in process on 1 Sept was delayed due to the crowd and we were told to take a seat with quite a number of other people in a waiting area in between check-in counter and breakfast area. We did notice some people had some welcome drinks but this was not offered to quite a number of other people including us. This is still okay for us but the area is quite hot and stuffy due to the number of people there and the area is very noisy. When we finally got our room card, we only found out that we cannot access our level and had to go back down again to fix the card after another person got off the elevator at his level. Not exactly a pleasant check-in experience. The room itself is nice, newly renovated with unique character and",5
Eli W,Great style and very accommodating.,"Great location with a colourful and cheerful interior. But this hotel has serious efficiency and service issues that even a 2-star hotel would get right. We checked in over the Hari Raya weekend and it was clear they were handling an unexpected volume of guests. But that is no excuse for how our room was not ready by the stated check-in time of 3pm, even though we specifically called ahead to ask for early check-in at 2pm and only arrived at 2.58pm. It was not a short delay. We waited 1 whole hour in the lobby, not being attended to or given drinks until we asked for them. We were not the only guests affected. Many others were waiting around at the lobby for their keycards. Telling guests you have an ""unexpected volume of guests over the busy weekend"" is no excuse. You are a",5
Jjster,Awesome Staycay,"Its quaint location offered easy sightseeing in suburban Katong district and access to local food. Loved the room interior and its attention to detail. The breakfast package offered ala-carte options - which was great! I loved the rooftop pool and gym, facilities exceeded expectations. Befitting of a themed boutique hotel.",5
JohanBeukema,Great boutique style hotel!,"I travel to Singapore on business regularly from the UK. This hotel is not only convenient for my office and the airport, it is in Katong which is a vibrant neighbourhood, in my opinion far superior to the bland downtown areas around Orchard Road. The staff are very professional and very welcoming, the rooms are very well appointed, the breakfast is superb. I travel a lot for work and it is generally not pleasurable but Hotel Indigo makes my trips to Singapore very pleasant.",5
Y2226CPianb,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,They took care of us when we arrived very early and checked us in at 10:30. The style of this hotel is great and very local. Service is solid. Very new hotel and amazing pool with the best view. Staff is super young and helpful.,4
Kuromi_26,Perfect relaxing stay,"Booked this place for a birthday celebration and because of its peranakan style and super loving it! The front desk staff - Anuka (Hope I got your name right) was super friendly with her smiles and meticulous in introducing the hotel and facilities. Booked a premier room and the tub overlooks the most awesome sight around katong. (Hotel was great in assisting for a great view as it was a special occasion.) The room was comfy with its decor, there was a nespresso machine as well as complimentary sweets, and the housekeeping crews were super friendly. Breakfast at Baba Chews was superb! Highly recommend this hotel and it's facilities. Kudos to its friendly and ever helpful staffs from front desk to housekeeping even the breakfast lounge!",5
Vaggelis P,Honeymoon,"I stayed here for a week while on business trip. Nice atmosphere, boutique style hotel. Rooms large enough, with style and very clean. Bed was comfortable. Nice swimming pool on the roof plus fitness room. Breakfast was good, served in a restaurant directly attached to the hotel lobby. The area around the hotel is nice with quite some good restaurants as well as a shopping mall. The only thing I missed a bit was a desk in the room to work on, but the comfortable chair near the window compensated for it!",5
Peter K,"Great hotel, great location","Hotel indigo is situated in Katong which is a 15 min cab ride from the airport and the city. Katong is a very vibrant and historical neighbourhood with loads of heritage buildings and great shops and dining. The hotel is in my experience faultless with excellent staff, great rooms and great food. Go there 👌",5
borneo88,A great neigbourhood hotel in a charming area of Singapore,Well designed hotel with spacious rooms. Love the Colours and the layout of the 'double' restrooms. The roof pool was amazing with great views. Went on on a weekday and it was just so wonderful to chill out at the pool during the evening . Breakfast was also nice at baba Chews. Excellent service by the staff there. Just a short ride to the seafood centre at East Coast parkway and tons of food and shops around Katong . Will be back .,5
Carolyn U,What a very pleasant surprise!,"Fantastic hotel! With five stars staff! From where to start. Gentle, sincere greetings, awesome breakfast. Fantastic view , Clean, large room with all amenities. Amazing place to turn the beautiful Singapore. If I had another star I will give u with all my heart!. 6 star hotel....!!! Thanks for all INDIGO....:)",5
dubstatik,"Lovely hotel, but....",Perfect for a stopover as you are only 15 mins to airport and 15 minutes to cbd. Taxis are not expensive so anyway is easy to get to. The area of katong is so vibrant and alive with restaurants and shops and the hotel itself is truly wonderful. Would recommend a stay here,5
Rory James DOYLE,Pleasant but not practical,"Based on our experiences at the Indigo on the Bund in Shanghai and the Indigo in the former German concession in Tinjian in China we decided to stay in Katong during our last visit to Singapore. The hotel shares the drive way with the Express by Holiday Inn which is located one of the 2 tower blocks. The former colonial type police station which gives credence to the ""neighbourhood story"" houses a restaurant and meeting rooms and is connected to the main tower by a covered walk way. The rooms reflect the Pernakan neigbour hood style. Sound proofing is poor. Our neigbours were celebrating their wedding proposal in the hotel and came back to continue partying at 3am...... The rooms are more suitable for leisure guests as there is no writing desk and decent chair. However there",5
lifeisbeaut,Great hotel with character and comfort,"For years we have been stopping over in Singapore to and from other Asian destinations and have stayed in (and tried) many hotels. This one is an excellent find. We now know that we have found our ""home"" in Singapore. The rooms are big, very tastefully decorated (the Peranakan theme is very solid and well done!) very comfortable and clean. The breakfast is great (although it took a long time for the coffee to arrive - looked like there was confusion with the orders) but nevertheless, the rest of the breakfast experience was excellent (and specially good to be able to order from a menu and not have to deal with a big buffet). The area around the hotel is very interesting with lots of places you can walk to and explore. It's closer to the airport which suits us as we don't need to",5
ciaramc82,Gorgeous hotel to base yourself in Singapore,"This is a lovely hotel with very attractive, quirky rooms. The staff were friendly. There is a nice rooftop pool with great views. The hotel is in an excellent location - Katong is a fun area with lots of places to eat and drink. Unfortunately I was given a room with a connecting door to another room. This meant that the noise level was pretty high (there were a couple of teenage boys next door). I did ask for another room, but the hotel was full, which meant I had to put up with the noise. It's a shame, as I really liked this hotel. I will return, but will definitely specify a room with no connecting door next time.",5
Glen T,Funky and stylish in Katong,"Indigo Hotel, part of the IHG Group of hotels, is certainly a charming hotel but is not a business hotel as there is no desk in the room and hardly any work space in the room either. Its not a business hotel. If you are on vacation it is fine.",4
Margaret K,Fabulous Hotel in every way.,"This hotel was great. We booked king bed deluxe room, were upgraded to king bed premier view room. We have been to Singapore many times and stayed in many hotels and all are comfortable but not particularly memorable and bland. This hotel has a lot of character and charm, loved the decor, felt very unique yet modern at the same time. The hotel was very clean, wifi worked well, good shower, good views, comfortable bed, nice toiletries. The infinity pool on roof was nice and the gym was one of the best we experienced in a hotel. We only stayed for one night in between flights and paid bit extra for 6pm checkout to use hotel until flight, and they were accommodating with this. The restaurant at the hotel was average but there are so many good places to eat nearby anyway. The area",5
