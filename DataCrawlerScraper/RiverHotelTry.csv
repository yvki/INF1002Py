Disneydreamer22,loved it here,"Have just spent 4 comfortable days here.From check in by the fantastic Ronnie such a nice guy ,to a quiet room ,which i didn’t think was going to be as we were at the front where we could see right across and up the river. You could hear the traffic but it just sounds like the wind we were on the 8th floor the traffic did not keep me awake .I could hear a tv slightly at 4 in the morning but again it didn’t keep me awake . There are only 2 things i wasn’t keen on the bed was way too hard and there’s no on-site parking they only do valet parking on a fri/ sat then they take it to a parking lot that you yourselves do about 2 blocks over they do validate the tickets so they cost slightly less i would stay here again",5
Gurudesh,Great location,"Great location but do not expect good service. Seems management does not care. Checking and checkout was great. Staff provided everything that was requested. There was no utensils, cutlery in the room although we had kitchenette. No bath soap in the bathroom. No extra towels. Little disappointed by lack of attention.",3
hancouk,It’s ok but it’s average at best,"We have stayed in CQ Hotels before so we had an idea what to expect and hoped for as good an experience as in previous locations they operate. It wasn’t what we expected, partly to be blamed on the pandemic of course as the accommodations industry is likely still looking to recover from that , plus we are on the brink of recession (or it has started) The reception area focuses on self service and that’s ok. There is help for people who need it. Our room was small, quite cramped for $400 for two nights I think. We were on the 8th floor, in 808. There is no safe in the room, so think about that regarding valuables. The bedroom window was “frosted” and that helped with the fact that the view is of a wall lol We flew into the city and needed to iron a couple of shirts. There was",3
Tony C,River Hotel elevators are fine.,,5
emmahalpin2022,Beautiful building and hotel,"The reviews on the elevator being out at the River Hotel are incorrect. They do have an elevator out in the Club Quarters section of the building that has two hotels. I was concerned reading other reviews about having long waits to the room. So as of August 27, 2022 both are working for the River Hotel. Our Superior River view room is nice, outside of the view of the hideous view of the Trump building. Not to be missed is the 24 hour coffee machine on the second floor. I will say when we got back with our friends from dining and drinks last night the did seem to be a long queue of disgruntled guest waiting for the single Club Quarters elevator.",5
Mairi B,A bit disappointing,"We stayed for an anniversary trip and had a river view—which was breathtaking. The hotel staff were great, it was quiet and clean. Great experience overall. We were able to walk to many attractions and sites easily as well.",3
d g,Great location but that's about it,"We were in town scouting hotels with high school friends for an upcoming reunion, and let me first say that the customer service we encountered in Liz and Ronnie was amazing! The location of this hotel is perfect, close to the river walk and transportation, so we found it very easy to navigate from the hotel. We had a lovely view of the river from one of our windows out of our tiny room. The room however was super small and one had to side step at the bottom of the bed, or crawl over the bed in order to get to the other side. The bathroom was rather small as well, but everything worked and the water pressure was good. The biggest problem was the fact that there was only one working elevator to take guests up to floors 11-35. We heard that the other elevator had been ""out""",2
Sina,The worst stay ever,,1
Rob M,Parking will cost you.,"Pokey rooms, one working lift for 38 floors, ~15 minute queues for elevator. A lot of money for over filled lifts and an average at best stay. We had thought this would be a good candidate for our upcoming reunion. With no good way to get to and from the rooms, it clearly is not on the list.",3
Emmanuel R,Well located in the loop,"I booked this hotel through Booking.com. I filtered for 4-star hotels and this property showed up. However, when I got there, I realized that the hotel is 3-STAR. I contacted the property manager and he also confirm that the hotel is 3-star. Here is his reply ""We are actually a 3-star hotel, We are rated as a 4- star hotel due to guest reviews!"" The hotel room is old and dirty, with a tiny bathroom, no safe box in the room and they do not provide breakfast. The air conditioner was making a shrieking noise. So, be aware that the hotel is actually WORSE than a 3-star hotel. I contacted booking.com and they said they are not responsible for the star rating. Property managers also ignored my messages, and simply ruined my honeymoon. Please see the photo that I posted with this",4
Adam F,"Great Location, Decent Hotel",,5
rktrump,Will absolutely stay here again,"Price was fantastic. Room was basic. There was a pull out couch that turned into a bed. Great views from the front, but really no views from the back of the hotel. Parking is a pain. You have to walk a few blocks and pay $55 a night. Not the worst option, but keep in mind it is downtown. Staff was friendly and helpful.",3
Andrea L,Horrendous,"I went there for a business trip. The hotel is clean, ideally located in the loop along the river. Everything is reachable by walk. My room was a little bit too small with a small window. At that time the breakfast was served in the room but was quite good.",3
manuh620,Location is great,"The location of the hotel is perfect, easily within walking distance of public transportation for attractions and airport connection. The simple offerings of the hotel are just as advertised, however the elevators are confusing and a hassle. Only one of the elevators for Floors 12 and above was working during my stay, and this often meant 5 minute waits to go up or down Otherwise the stay was perfect and the view from the 30+ floors Is great",5
Me_n_my_rucksack,"Exactly what we wanted.... perfect location, clean comfortable and friendly hotel.","I would absolutely stay here again. I sprung for a room with a view of the river. That means I paid more for this hotel than I typically like to for a place where I just need to lay my head. But it turns out it was totally worth it. The view was downright amazing - and so peaceful to look at before heading to bed each night. My 9-year-old son particularly loved this routine. And, the location is great. I may have planned to be out all day, but with this awesome central location, I could pop by the hotel if I needed to in the middle of our adventures. Hardly needed the staff, to be honest. But the couple times I did need something (extra pillows and blankets), they came straight to my room. I read some other reviews that made me think the room would be tiny. It wasn't at",5
susan,"Excellent location, comfortable stay","We were so excited to find such a seemingly nice hotel bailable for a “last minute” booking. We called to insure an early check-in due to our flight arrival being in the morning. We were told we could check in at 11:00. At 11:00 we were told 1:00, then at 1:00 we were told 3:00. We got to the hotel at 2:30 and were told that a room was available and it was an “upgrade”. We paid for a king room with room for a fold out or pack-n-play. The room we were given (704) was extremely tiny, no room for any additional bed, and the window was smaller than a jail cell. Attaching a photo of our “upgraded king bed”, that was 2 twin beds pushed together. There was no breakfast available, the water machine on the floor didn’t work, and we weren’t provided any of the requests we asked for.",3
Hey_girl_hey86,Location!,The hotel is very well situated for a trip to Chicago. Breakfast included shouldn’t be booked. It is not worth it. It is a hassel with the vouchers (usd 25) and fairly expensive for the choice and service you get.,2
Pete S,Location,"When visiting a City you are unfamilliar with it can be hard to trade off price against quality when you know very little about the neighbourhoods etc... we struck very lucky with the Riverside as the price was very reasonable and the location perfect. A 5 or 10 min stroll from Clark on the Blue CTA line the Riverside is located (as the name implies) on the riverside - when you walk out of the front door the view is a real wow.... its within walking distance everything downtown. The location really is spot on. Check in is supposedly carried out via terminals in the lobby, but one of the friendly folks went through it with us. The Building is historic - with a genuine historic feel to it in the entranceway - which could mean dated I guess - but there is absolutley",1
Michele R,Stay away. Overpriced for what you get,"River Hotel is in an excellent location for downtown and all its attractions. Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable. We appreciated the free laundry, the gym and the club room for relaxing during the day. The only thing that could have been improved was the room decor which was dated and a bit gloomy.",3
Paulade,"Location, location !!!",We stayed here for Monsta X concert at the Chicago Theatre. The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect. It’s right in the middle of everything you could need. We parked about 3 blocks away and never needed to drive the entire 4 day stay. Food-entertainment-parks-Navy Pier- you name it. It was absolutely the best place for the money. Surprisingly quiet at night too! We didn’t hear a thing from neighbors or outside.,4
Alexandra S,Ronnie and the QR code,"Great location if interested in Mag Mile and Loop. Available river view rooms. Hotel staff is friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. Check in is easy with Club Quarter App. Easy check out as well. Close to great restaurants and activities. Highly recommended for great value.",5
maumaujr,Location versus price,One of the ugliest hotels I've ever stayed in. The price is absolutely not justified. Breakfast was not available and we were given vouchers for the restaurant next door which weren't enough. The safe was missing. Ugly room with an old bathroom with shower with plastic curtain and no shower gel. No room cleaning service (unacceptable). We asked for two separate beds and they gave us a normal bed and a sofa bed with a mattress full of humps where it was not possible to sleep. Stay away,3
04Stephanie2022,Good hotel for short trip,Hotel is in a great location !! Set on the south bank of the river it’s in the perfect place to explore the north side or the south side !! The room we had was really small with a window (but no view) If the price is really good then it’s a good option !!,3
melodiegarrett,Perfect Location,"Ideal location. Dream view. Comfortable and spacious rooms. I'm not sure that the outsourced breakfast orderable from a QR code and delivered to your room is progress, especially when it is over 30mn late. But this was compensated by ""smooth groove"", jiving Ronnie's warm welcome. He greets you with a smile, a joke, a song, and has solution for everything in ""less than one minute"". It was lovely being greeted in the evening on my way in to the hotel by ""Welcome back, Milady!"" In these days of QR codes, this quality of human service is greatly appreciated.",5
Johan F,"Perfect location, value for money",The best location in Chicago for a very low price... In front of Trump Tower. Close to a lot of atractions! We do almost everything on foot. The best choice at the Loop. Everything was grade 10 (from 0 to 10)!,5
kellygumps1975,Great hotel great price,I came here for a weekend birthday trip. Room wasn’t the biggest but for only two people it got the job done. We spent about 4 hours a day (aside from sleeping) in there and it didn’t feel cramped at all.,3
TravelingWithJ,Quaint hotel in the heart of Chicago,"The location if this hotel is wonderful. Easy access to the many sites to see. The hotel staff was VERY accommodating and helpful. This may be an older hotel compared to most and we did have some trouble with our room, but we were moved to a different room.",2
craol02,Great hotel,Excellent location at the river. Close to magnificent mile and the loop. Room well appointed and clean. Somewhat low pressure in the shower. No cleaning on daily basis due to Covid regulations. Self check-in very simple and quick. Recommended.,1
asalgad01979,Cozy and luxurious.,This was an amazing hotel for the price. Very comfortable beds and pillows(with back issues this is HUGE) there is no resturant but a great roof top right next door. Very clean and easy to navigate. Just remember there is an amazing river view(friends had that room we had city view) so ask for the river rooms 604 for sure had a great view! City view was good also but I went for the green river! Thank goodness friends got the river view so we could see it from above,3
juancovault,The River Hotel,"Stayed 2 days for a conference. Historic building conversion with great access to Michigan Ave. Quiet, updated room, comfortable bed and PILLOWS. Easy app check-in, good WiFi, and chilled purified water on the floor was a plus. Would stay again without hesitation.",4
r0nyd0s02003,Good location and facilities,The staff was phenomenal. The room superseded my expectations. It was amazing. Only issue I would say is the beds are very firm and was a bit uncomfortable for my husband and I. Everything else was fantastic.,5
Kara H,Great value,"Room was cozy, clean and stocked. Staff was polite, welcoming and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back. Fitness gym, coffee in the rooms, coffee in club living room. Bottled water accessible on every floor as well as ice. It was great.",3
Madaline P,Pictures on line do not reflect realty,"It has a beautiful view. The room was small, but clean. They offer coffee and other drinks free of charge on 2nd. floor. The staff were nice! I just wish the bathroom was better. However, it was clean.",3
Lissie,Coming Back!,"In the downtown center where you can walk to many landmark. Water station at every floor, guest laundry is free. Elevator were old and sometimes problem happened, hope can be maintained better. Parking always an issue in downtown... Can be very expensive, get ready to walk further to get a cheaper parking slot",5
Kimjbaumann,"Great location, attentive staff","The River Hotel is located in a great spot and it’s very easy to walk to popular areas like the Bean, Magnificent Mile, and a lot of shops/restaurants. The price was great for the location. The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean. Would definitely stay here again.",5
tcmalsch,Great location,"Check in/check out-staff didn't offer up any information about the hotel and its amenities. We had to change our room to a larger room last minute to add our son but was never told that we would be charged extra for an additional person in a larger room that was supposed to accommodate 3 people. The pull out bed had no blankets, called for a blanket, waited an hour then went down to the front desk to ask about the blanket in person since we were ready to go to sleep. The pillows were hard as rocks. There was no light in the area of the room where the pull out bed was. I moved one of the lamps by our bed to the pullout bed area and noticed the lamp shade was broken and the screw that holds the shade on was gone. When opening the door to our room, we were on the 9th floor room",3
yagalina57,Great location,"I will like to start by saying that I can't wait to go back! Chicago is my only favorite city in the USA. The view to the river was amazing! Location was an A+ being close to most attractions at walking distance. A 7 eleven around the corner was convienient as well. The check-in was easy through a kiosk and if any issues, they are right there to help you. If you park at 20 E Randolph St. self-parking, the hotel will give you a discount and you pay only $25 for 24hrs. For me, that is a good deal for being parked right in the city. This parking lot is a 6 minute walk from hotel. The hotel and parking lot is a short walking distance to Boat tours, River walk and rest. (accross the street) Nutella, Cloud Gate and other attractions. The hotel was bulit in 1928 and you can tell buy",2
chicagoans,Great Stay Near River!,"We found this hotel to be perfect for our needs, with a central location near Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, and many restaurants. All the staff was helpful as needed. Only complaint would be that the sofa bed in our room was not adequate for sleeping, was fine as a sofa.",1
GDSM2016,Avoid it!!,"Enjoyed our view and location. We were next door to London house and across street of Trump building! Within walking distance of Millenium park, art museum, state street shopping, Michigan avenue. Rooms were spacious, with micro and small refrigerator. Lobby was clean and front desk very helpful. Price was very reasonable!",3
Pennie41,The rooms,"We enjoyed our stay in a room with a great river view. We booked a Superior Queen room and it included a kitchenette (mini fridge, microwave and a coffee machine) and a sofa and was spacious The shower has a flexible hose which I like better than what most US hotels.have. We liked that the hotel has water station with refillable bottles on each floor - kudos to the hotel for being environmentally friendly The location is great - close to the Riverwalk, the lake and Millennium park. Also the staff is professional, helpful and friendly. Good value for money.",4
Tania M,Great location!,"We stayed at the River Hotel after a wedding, and before the Chicago Triathlon. The front desk staff was very accommodating and friendly. They were flexible with our checkout time after the race, and very nice about checking our bags after that. They even let us check a bike :) I would definitely stay here again!",5
Beauregard70,Made Our Trip to Chicago,"Avoid this hotel at any cost!!! Even though it looks clean and it’s location is superb, THEY DONT CLEAN THE ROOMS. We needed to clean ourselves. The excuse? The pandemic. Pandemic is no excuse for being filthy. Personnel is very friendly though. Anyway, I’m not staying here anymore and I recommend anyone not to as well.",3
Gina M.,Enjoyed our stay,"This hotel allowed dogs, which was not a bad thing. However, my room has a dried urine spot on the floor. I was told (at check-in) that housekeeping doesn't go into every room and that if my room needed anything to call and let them know. The carpet in the rooms need to be cleaned after a family leaves that has a dog.",3
Heather F,"2 star quality, 4 star price.",Great location for an affordable price. Excellent customer service and fast check in and check out. We had an amazing view from our room to the river. Parking available with valet parking service few blocks away. We will stay at The River hotel again for sure!,5
paulgeldridge,Nice,"This was a 3 day / 2 night father/son trip to Chicago. The location was perfect, the facilities were absolutely awesome, and the staff was over the top helpful and friendly. We asked lots of silly tourist questions and they patiently answered all of our questions with a smile. Thank you so much, River Hotel! We will absolutely be back and we will absolutely recommend you!",5
aprilm1232021,Excellent Choice for Your Stay,"Loved the location! The close proximity to trains, River walk, parks, Lake Michigan, museums, restaurants, and shopping made it very easy to see and do everything on our list and more! The complimentary water filling stations are a nice touch and helped us stay hydrated during the week. We also enjoyed the other amenities like the gym, free laundry and espresso machines. On the down side, our room was very small (hubby had to turn sideways to get around the bed it’s so close to wall) and bed was a full sized mattress, not a queen as advertised. this took a little getting used to since my husband and I are both on the taller and bigger side. Bed was not the most comfortable and pillows were too firm for my own personal taste. Most of the hotel staff we interacted with were",3
yourcakequeen,Great place to stay.,"I don’t normally leave negative reviews; but for what I paid for this room, I felt very ripped off. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a piece of plywood held up by springs. The room was tiny with a tiny window. There were greasy fingerprints all over high contact areas. There was a stain on the carpet that my son kept referring to as “the poopy stain” which looked accurate. Old musty looking shower curtain, rust on towel holders. Just overall not the experience I was expecting for the price.",2
Anne S,"Make sure everything works, and if you need something just ask.","We enjoyed the hotel, the location was convenient. Access to everything we were interested in doing was great. The views of Chicago were good. We would stay here again if need be. We would recommend this hotel to others.",1
Mitchell F,Extremely Disappointed!!,This property was an excellent choice for our first trip to Chicago! The centralized location is within walking distance to most places/attractions and also close to train and bus stops. The view from our room was great and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. We will most definitely be back to the River Hotel in the future.,3
Jasmine G,TOP TIER,Everyone was so nice and friendly. It was in a great location. The bed was ok. The pillow was a little to firm for me but overall the room was nice. I liked that they had water that you could put in bottles to take with you.,4
Journey458289,Great hotel,"I've stayed here before. And the cleanliness, area, and location keep me coming back. BUT I feel in time certain things in the room need to be fixed or replaced. Plus you have to ask for everything in room room, like iron, ironing board, kitchenware utensils, which is fine, but takes a while sometimes. The TV remotes only worked sometimes. I was able to sign into Netflix, but unable to sign out. And all the outlets in my headboard and night stand were not working. Uploading the app was pointless because it asks for a reservation code, a confirmation code, and I just wound up going to one of the kiosks upon arrival anyways.",5
morganaromanowski,"Great hotel, wonderful front desk staff",We paid over $200 for a room at this “beautiful” hotel. We got to our room and there were NO WINDOWS. We were on the 10th floor. We felt like we slept in a basement. There was also no mini fridge so our food went to waste. We called and asked if we could upgrade and they said there were no rooms available. But all of the other rooms on our floor had no occupancy all night?? Absolute waste of money.,3
sarahE6579EM,Good for the money,"I am an extremely picky person and I LOVED this hotel! If you have a family you wont regret staying here I promise! Best hotel I have ever stayed in by far. They make everything convenient for you, the check in is a breeze (you can check in from your phone), the hotel is separated by two sides which makes elevators quick and not crowded and they're room key operated so you don't have to worry about a bunch of random people running the floors of your hotel. They have water stations with purified water on each floor and offer new clean water bottles for you to fill up. Also whenever you need room service you can simply send a text message and they will bring whatever you need to your room, you never have to go to the front desk. The bedding is luxury and the most comfortable I",3
hend0428,parking garage/outdate rooms,"Overall we had a great stay. HVAC was a little noisy (rattling sound) in one of our two rooms, but that's the only complaint. I didn't bring it up to the staff, though. Staff was super friendly and helpful, location is great. Everything seemed very clean.",5
Kathy F,River Hotel in 2021,"We will be back! Got our room with a view like we asked for which we really appreciated. Had an issue with my card declining upon check in because I forgot to raise my daily limit, the guy at the front desk was VERY helpful and kind with the whole thing. View was amazing. We loved it all",5
teskridge64,Review of River Hotel,"Overall this was a good stay! the location and staff were awesome. The rooms just felt dirty with stained sheets and the corner of the room had a very dirty wall and floor. You can’t beat the price for this location, we were able to walk all over and I felt very safe in the hotel.",3
413aubrey,Good stay,"AC didn't work, light was out in bathroom. Rooms are very outdated and you pay a premium for that. We had parking included/booked directly with hotel and Bell Staff told us the wrong parking address so we got an unexpected $150 charge. When we told the manager this upon check out, I was told we should have checked in with the front desk. I guess it was our fault the bell staff didn't give the correct information out.",2
rsamuelson79,Great Price and Location,"We visited River Hotel during the week of May 17th, 2021 and were very impressed with their COVID protocols. They have taken every precaution to make their patrons' stay as safe as possible while also having an amazing stay. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Danny who helped us with registration. He was extremely helpful and courteous. He made sure to give us a room with a view of the Chicago River and answered all our questions during our stay. Our room location was quiet the our entire stay. We truly appreciated his hospitality along with the rest of the staff. A big plus is that he is bilingual in Spanish so we got to practice with him. We look forward to a future stay at the River Hotel and hope to have Danny be there to welcome us!",1
abdulmajid247,No nearby parking. Parking price per night is ver much,"This hotel was a great value. The location/view was amazing. The staff had over the top customer service. I have never been treated better at a hotel. Our stay was during COVID so some of the amenities were not available, but that was understandable.",3
lawrencebooth122,Amazing,"The two bed suite with kitchenette was perfect for our one night stay, close walk to the loop, and all downtown areas. Overall a great stay and will return in the future. Only complaint is the thermostat in the room did not work well and was very hot and stuffy and night",4
harper0409,Decent not Special Stay,The hotel was great! Check in was very easy and the valet service was great. The front desk representatives were kind and helpful! The hotel room was clean and a comfortable size. The location is great for the river walk and getting to the parks.,5
ahcielo19,Small room...great view!,We were 2 adults and one child. The bed was not enough for us. There was a sofa bed but no extra blanket. I booked room with river view but they gave us room with no view. Front desk staff they just make there hours.,3
leesalafollette56,River Hotel,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you for the great experience. I am very satisfied with my stay and would like to come back again soon. Also, the woman that was working the front desk when I checked in was by far the most beautiful woman I have ever met in my entire life. She should be modeling somewhere. I wish I would have told her this at the time instead of in this message. Anyways thank you for the excellent service.",3
gabriellezaghi,Great service!,"Decent hotel for the price, removed amenities due to COVID-19. Room was clean and bathroom was clean. Rooms in the tower (above floor 24) are small in space (warning we did not know when they offered us a better view of the river it’s less space). Also our room temperature was 88° and when we called they said we can’t control temperatures in the tower and told the temp drops to 32° outside at night but no one can sleep in an 88° room. We needed a fan all night for 3 nights in winter. I would suggest staying in floor 9 river view as my other family did.",5
Ms. TC,Great Stay!,Loved how close everything was and everyone gave great customer service. Room was tiny and didn't like that at all. Bed was nice and firm and slept very well even with city outside. I just wish that the size of the room would have matched the price of the room.,5
Marina M,Cozy,I love this hotel. Close to restaurants and shopping. Very clean and follows all Covid protocols. Check in was at the front desk because of third party booking. But loved using the mobile key. Has issue with TV but it was resolved quickly. I highly recommend this hotel because of the price and location.,3
chumphries20152020,Amazing Hotel,"The location is amazing! Close to everything, makes easier to walk around. A lot of great spots close to the hotel. Their employees are very kind, sweet and friendly, they made de experience way better and that was very helpful!",2
Mely991,Very Accommodating with Booking during COVID-19,I got 'stuck' in the city because of the surging rideshare rates that evening (the room + the ride home the next day was still LESS than the surge rates!). I decided a hotel would be more economical. Found this place and checked in late. What a gem! The location was right on the river and I had a great view. The staff was very helpful and accomodating. Serg greeted me at the reception desk and was super helpful. The room was clean and the hotel did a great job of adhering to covid guidelines. I can't wait to return here in the future.,1
Derek O,Top Notch Hotel,Perfect location right on the river and near millennium park. Dated hotel but very attentive staff. Following very strict COVID restrictions which was comforting. Very secure. Entrance to lobby and elevators by key card only.,3
Sergio S,Great Location & views,"Amazing hotel! Very clean, amazing views, and amazing value. The River Hotel was in a prime location. Within walking distance to every major attraction and very safe. Will stay here again when I visit Chicago!",4
JonasYngvi,"Great staff, comfortable room",I am very pleased with my experience with the River Hotel Chicago. I was planning to visit Chicago but due to COVID-19 I was unable to make the visit due to the travel restrictions. I had a non-cancellable booking for this hotel with Expedia and I received an email notification saying that I could cancel this booking with full refund due to the River Hotel being very understanding and accommodating. All of this I was able to process online which really reduced my stress on how to get money back from my trip and eliminated the need for me to call Expedia and wait on the line for a long time due to abnormal call volumes. Thank you River Hotel for being the most positive booking from all of my trips I had planned during this time I will not forget it and once I have the,5
dalecrook82,Wonderful!,"Really enjoyed staying in this lovely hotel in the most beautiful city. Location is fantastic, right on the river and walking distance to everything in the heart of the city. Staff were really kind and helpful, especially Pedro. Room was nice with an amazing view. Free wine at 5pm every Monday to Friday. Price was very good, although we did travel in the off peak season. Would really recommend staying here if you are visiting Chicago. Would love to return some day!",3

Keith A,Good Hotel / Location,"I stayed at the River hotel for one night only. I just whish I could have been longer. The staff was very friendly. Location was great, next to the Magnificent mile. Clean and comfotable room. If I am ever inn Chicago again River hotel will beið þú choise.",5
JVhoose,Fun!,"Pedro, Sierra, and Mila went above and beyond! My fiance (Katie) and I stayed at the hotel for our one year engagement anniversary and Katie's birthday. I spoke with Mila on the phone and mentioned the special occasion. She said she would make sure we had an upgraded room with a good view, she did not disappoint! We checked in with Sierra and Pedro, we were impressed right from the start. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating, we couldn't of asked for more. We instantly felt like welcomed family. The room was perfect with an absolutely beautiful view, and to our surprise, they had left a birthday card for Katie and a happy anniversary card for the both of us. With hand written messages on both, not just a printed out quote. It was a very personal touch and made us feel",5
Stephen O,"Would highly recommend it, great experience","I spent 2 nights there and was not able to sleep. The staff put me in a room where the headboard of the bed is the same wall that the elevator shaft is in, so all night you just hear the elevators going up and down. Location is good, and it is very inexpensive, but those are the only two positive things that I can say about it. The rest of the place was mediocre, or below average. The carpet is old, worn out, and stained. The room is extremely cramped, for example, the bathroom doesn't even have a single drawer in it, so they hang the hair dryer in a bag on the backside of the door on a towel hook. Their is no ironing board or iron, so if you are traveling for business and need to iron your shirts/pants/suits, you are out of luck. The bed frame is one of those old metal ones",3
LadyTexan80,Fantastic views in the heart of the city,"My wife and I stayed here for the Taste Of Chicago. Checkin was early afternoon and we were greeted warmly. We used Lyft or walked to travel around the area as this hotel is downtown right off the Chicago River and downtown parking is very costly. The room was fresh, and had all amenities of home(Fridge, Microwave, Coffee Maker, etc.). The bed was very comfortable and we had a GREAT view of the river and city. I rate this hotel 4.5 stars. I would stay here again when I return to Chicago.",2
Finqb13,New Years Getaway,The River hotel is in a great location and everyone was very helpful with upgrades as well as recommendations in the area! The accommodations were perfect for a quick overnight trip to the city with my daughter.,1
Connor W,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Stayed here over a split week, 1 night then returned for 4 nights. Great experience overall. Comments on staff at the bottom, fantastic service + Great location, right by the river + Reasonable price + Room furnishing was minimalist and new looking + Clean rooms + Big TV in the room + Very comfortable bed and pillows + Water stations throughout the hotel were a nice touch, haven't seen that in other + Complimentary snacks on the 2nd floor + Free wine in the lobby Monday to Thursday We left our bags in the hotel over the weekend and the staff had no issues keeping them safe for us. In particular Pedro at the front desk made our stay 5 stars, always so polite and accommodating. He made us feel extremely welcome and as we were checking out he went out of his way to say",3
Kimberly C,Friendly staff and location,"We stayed in the River Hotel in August and November for quick trips to Chicago for fun/food/theatre, and both stays were wonderful. While there is no on-site restaurant, during the week the hotel uses the common area on the second floor for complimentary snacks and coffee. We didn't find this a problem, as we were there to explore what the city had to offer, and we did enjoy the snacks going in and out. Both times, we booked a double queen room, which I highly recommend. It was extremely spacious and included two bathrooms. For two sisters, even as adults, it was a dream come true! Ha. We had a gorgeous river view as well, and the room had all the amenities we needed, plus was very clean. We also enjoyed the free water bottle filling/refilling station and used it several times",4
821rachel,"Convenient, Friendly place to stay for work","Checked in on New Years Day by Sarah. Check in was fast, and we were in our room within 10 minutes. Valet parking was very convenient, but is $53 a day. We booked a superior room, which had a Keurig, microwave, and small fridge. Room also had a sofa sleeper. The bathroom had a walk-in shower. Our room “802” had a great view of the river. The hotel is steps from Michigan Ave, and within walking distance to most everything. This was our first stay here, and we will return.",5
GuillermoAvolio,Great Hotel!,Reserved a room a couple months ahead of going to Chicago. Called ahead before arriving and let them know that we were staying for an anniversary. They said they would make a note next to the reservation to see if they could upgrade our room for free. Pedro checked us in and he was very friendly and helpful. We got the upgraded room and even had a note and treats waiting for us when we walked into our room. Rooms are a little small but comfortable and views are WONDERFUL facing the river! Highly recommend this hotel with the super friendly staff and the location. Absolutely will be staying here again next time we visit Chicago!,3
christianvh2014,Perfect stay downtown Chicago,"The rooms generally are not large or ostentatious but small and comfortable. The biggest perks are the friendly and helpful staff, downtown location by the river and close to shopping, as well as UNLIMITED water and fabulous Columbian coffee!",3
Crystal J,Travel to Chicago,"I was able to check in early and was upgraded to a larger room if I downloaded the new app. Nicer room, still old-feeling, bare minimum amount of towels and they were scratchy but overall, the staff and amenities (like purified water on demand and snack area and lounge) made it a perfect spot for a night away for work. No big complaints, just small areas to improve. Ryan and his team were lovely and very helpful!",5

Carliena P,Bang for your buck!,Spent a week at the River Hotel in Chicago - great winter deals as the city is quite dead in December and it’s been on my bucket list for quite some time. We loved the River hotel with beautiful views of the River close walk to the trains (to the airport and for exploring the city) also close enough to walk for almost everything you want to check out in the city - the rooms are really nice and we loved the added touch of oranges and chocolate waiting for us when we arrived in our room. They have refillable water bottles on each floor which was super convenient and wastes less. If you check in you won’t be disappointed,2
Veggie4eva,Convenient location,"Just returned from thanksgiving in Chicago and have to say can’t speak more highly of the staff and the hotel, I arrived with no suitcase thanks to KLM and they could not be more helpful they advised me the quickest and easiest place I could get some clothes , they provided me with all my toiletries which when I got there was a big help , room was great even tho bathroom bit dated but me nip picking , I had a lovely view off the trump hotel and no matter how many times I bothered the staff with questions they were always happy to help and gave me great tips and advice I enjoyed my stay in Chicago I will return 1 day and most likely choose the river hotel 👍",1

DBest181,Stay at the River Hotel and enjoy all that Chicago has to offer!!,"Nice hotel with clean rooms. Rooms are small but manageable. A standard room comes with a queen bed, a desk and a chair and if you are lucky, you will get a room with a view. The river view is beautiful at day and at night. Good staff. Convenient location. CTA bus stops diagonally opposite to the hotel. Orange line gets you here from Midway, 5 minutes walk from State/ Lake. 24 hours coffee/ tea/ milk on level 2. Water station at every floor with bottles. The hotel has a very effective system to hold bags post checkout. You need the room key to access the elevator. Complimentary wine and cheese at 5 PM Monday to Thursday in the lobby area. Complimentary M&M, bar mix, peanuts and sunflower seeds for snack, fresh fruits and Pepsi brand sodas all day, again, only Monday to",5
David H,Great location. Historic building. Good rooms,"We visited in April and had a great stay at the River Hotel. The rooms are small but honestly we were comfortable. Kaina at the front desk was extremely helpful. She provided great ideas of where to visit and eat. Also, she was great with walking directions to make the most of our visit.",3

Duncan77773,Friendly Service.,"Love this Hotel it was clean, quiet and close to everything!! Whether for business or vacation this hotel fits the bill. Checking in and checking out was a breeze the restaurant next door delivers right to your room.",5
Don P,Very uncomfortable bed and linens,"Booked this hotel on a recommendation from someone, and very pleased I did. In the centre of town, overlooking the Chicago River with its historic bridges, plenty of bars, restaurants, supermarkets very close by, the Chicago River Walk is literally across the road. Room was very clean and comfortable, if a little tired looking. A bonus was the free laundry for guests. Would not hesitate to stay there again.",5
Jim R,Hope you like stairs,"Hotel is nice, clean and fairly well maintained. Unfortunately, my room was next to the elevator shaft so I heard the cars running all the time, but it wasn’t intolerable. Staff is nice and accommodating. There’s a nice bakery/coffee shop next door that’s convenient for an early morning snack. Being right next to Michigan Ave. is a big plus.",3
DisneyDarwin,A good choice,"Spent 2 weeks at the hotel and all I can say is WOW. All staff were friendly and helpful. Kudos to Ryan and Seth, who went out of their way to assist and make it a pleasurable stay. Thank you. 5 STARS",2
Gary W,Great hotel in downtown Chicago,"This hotel advertised a queen bed, but in reality it was two twin mattresses placed together. I sleep in the middle of the bed so this was most uncomfortable for me. Also the linens had way too much bleach on them to the point where I broke out in hives itching all night. Can't sleep had to prop myself up in the chair to try and sleep. I suppose to be here four nights, but I will check out after one.",1
donajenum,Exceeded my expectations.,"Elevators practically nonexistent. Waited a long, long time in most cases and one especially enjoyable morning (not) I had to walk down 22 flights of stairs after waiting ten minutes. No elevators, no sound of any elevators moving, nothing. Room was relatively clean and the view was nice, but bed was concave and not comfortable. When I checked out, nobody asked ""how was your stay?"" although I did get sort of a grunt, a if I had only mildly annoyed them by returning my keycard. Instead, they waited until I left and sent an email asking me to review them on tripadvisor, so here 'ya go. I hope not to return to this hotel between now and the end of time, but if I do, I will bring ""War and Peace"" to read while I await the elevator.",3
hunslet49,Super Suite,"I chose this hotel as a more affordable option in the area that I would be working. It was a good choice. Check-in was efficient, as was the staff. Public spaces were nice and the room was clean and comfortable, even if a little dated. The location was fantastic, and I would definitely stay here again.",4
jennlynn15,Definitely Recommend!!,"No negative comments about The River Hotel. Really cool, one of a kind rooms, very helpful staff, perfect location. Everything about the hotel was top notch. I'd definitely recommend, and will likely stay at the River during my next visit to Chicago.",5
John W,Very Pricy Basic hotel but at a Prime location in a fantasic City,"What can I say -- room was clean, all people who worked with us were knowledgeable and friendly. Not wild about the coffee the last two days, but that is my only downer. Felt very comfortable and ""homey."" I have already recommended it to several others.",3
Mike089MUC,Budget hotel at a classy location,I settled on the River Hotel based on its location – it was just so handy for everything. People may find it hard to believe but price was also a big factor in my decision making. I was going to be in Chicago for a week with my daughter and when I started looking at prices for 2 rooms in a hotel it actually worked out better for me to book a suite that we could share. I should point out that I booked it directly with the hotel to get a better price. Our suite had two beds in separate areas – they didn’t have doors but they were arranged to give plenty of privacy. There was also two bathrooms and a kitchen area. Although there was a coffee machine in the room there was also a coffee area in the hotel that you could access at any time. Another nice touch was free wine at 5 pm,3
jannatjjennipher,Deduction of my money from my credit card twice instead of once. First.deduction was 1520 dollars then 1250 dollars,I stayed here for the weekend. I arrived early and they let me check in early. They offered me either a room with a double bed with minimal view or a queen with no view. I went for the queen bed. I’m okay with small hotels room if you don’t prefer them then you won’t like this one. And I was okay with out a view because when you step outside it’s right on the river. I will say the rooms are out dated. But it was clean! I stayed here for the location. It was a short walk to Millennial Park and the Magnificent Mile. I also want to mention if you use Lyfts or Uber’s the location is hard for them to find. Not sure why but it gave every driver I had a problem.,5
GrandTour677004,Chicago River,"We write what we see and experience to hopefully help other out. Short version - Good - Location is brilliant with everything on your doorstep. View from our room was outstanding, right across from Trump Tower. Bad - it looks like its been squeezed in between two very nice hotels, one of which has a rooftop bar. Its very basic with no restaurant/bar, and the room we had was very small - see photos - Over all we didn't think it was worth the price because you could get a better hotel nearby at the same price or cheaper if you went further afield. Long version - Our first time in Chicago so the location of this hotel was the thing that stood out for us. not only was it on the river but the things we had booked and wanted to see/explore were within walking distance from it.

soniasalhi,"Good location, good hotel",I picked a hotel near the river and was happy with this random selection I made. Room suites were great. Front desk staff was awesome. We also were able to check our luggage in and go sightseeing before departing. I enjoyed the two bathrooms and also that there was space between both bed areas.,3
Carthagean,Good hotel in Chicago,"We booked this hotel based on proximity to the Chicago Theater because we were attending a concert there. Very pleasant staff. We requested a room with a view of the River and when we checked in, we did have the view (of TRUMP tower btw lol) but the room was tiny! No fridge, no microwave and we had to maneuver around each other as the closet and bathroom doors cannot be open at the same time. Small bathrooms of note. No room service. However, when we asked about whether or not a microwave was available, the extremely pleasant and helpful front desk agent offered to upgrade our room with a microwave, fridge, and the same view, one floor above. They offered to transfer our luggage and settle us in. The new room was larger and much less confining. Things you should know",4
Ted R,"Thoughtful management, central location, reasonable rates","The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Sierra in particular at the front desk was a bright light who provided us with so much information about best routes to take as well as restaurant tips over the course of our 4 day stay. She always seemed to be available when we needed help. Pedro and Emily also stand out, as well as others whose names we cannot recall. The location was terrific--overlooking the river (hence the name) with lots of great restaurants and sights within walking distance and very close to buses and trains. Complimentary coffee, water, snacks, fresh fruit, as well as a wine and cheese happy hour on weeknights! Our room was comfy and had plenty of space for the two of us.",5

Mike N,The Hotel,I enjoyed my stay in River hotel in magnificent mile in Chicago. Hotel is centrally located in downtown Chicago across from major sites and river. Hotel room was small but clean. Staff was helpful. The car garage parking was expensive at $59/night however that is the standard in Chicago,3
DanO68,Ideal location in the city center. Great hotel!!,My partner and i enjoyed the attractive lobby and our 21st floor room with clean spacious bathroom. A rare hotel where the thermostat is simple to operate. Another helpful rarity: hooks on the wall and the bathroom door. And every hotel should store irons and ironing boards as River Hotel does in a hallway closet instead of cluttering the room. We also appreciated the rack of self-serve water bottles facing the elevator on every floor. Ditto the late afternoon happy hour in the lobby. I'd only recommend they keep a list of neighborhood dining at reception desk.,5
ZapCa,Location you can't beat!,Staff very friendly and accommodating. Found the location to be ideal for Chicago's Riverwalk and boat trips. Had enough staff on hand when questions were on hand. Was happy that we didn't have to use phone as a key.,5

NPHarper,Perfect hotel for weekend getaway in Chicago,"All-around great experience at this hotel. It is well located in the heart of the city center, and right across the road from the river and associated River Walk. Only about a 15min walk down to the lake. It was easy to get to and find, easily accessed from a number of nearby train stations coming from the airport. The team at reception was awesome – very friendly and helpful and got us checked in and scoped out very quickly. We had an amazing room overlooking the river and across to Trump Tower. The room was luxurious - very big, bright, and airy with everything you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber. The bed was very comfortable, there was little if any road noise, so we had a great few sleeps. The free Wifi internet was good and fast and there was a chilled water dispenser",2
tuncborcbakan,Excellent Location in Chicago,"The location of the hotel is not just 10, but 100! Thought if it everytime i went back to the hotel after sightseeing.

If you are on the other side - you are facing Chicago River and Trump Tower, which us another wow view!! The room itself was very tiny, that's the only drawback, but other than that it is clean, nicebedding, etc. Filtered water on floors, snacks and coffee on the second floor (always)!!! Amazing stay! The big bus tour bus stop #1 is just across the hotel entrance - again +100 points!!! The parking is crazy expensive - $53 per day, but it's like that everywhere in tbe vicinity, even more expensive. It's inly valet parking, so",1
Greg,Great location and great views,"A group of us spent four nights at this hotel. We were pleased with our spacious executive suite accommodations. The beds were very comfortable. Housekeeping service was efficient and kept us well-supplied with towels and toiletries. The location is outstanding- many restaurants and attractions are within a reasonable walking distance. Our suite was near the back of the building, so we were not disturbed by a lot of street noise at night. The elevators were available with very little wait. The bell stand staff were friendly and helpful arranging transportation. Very few (fixable) problems- one bedroom did not cool off at night and the deadbolt lock on the outer door was stripped. The attached restaurant is closed, but there are two places next door for breakfast. I would",3

Jessica K,Downhill since 2016...prices increased though,"We stayed in the ""River Hotel"" part of the property, which seems to be separate from the Club Quarters Hotel. We were very happy with the outstanding location on the river, the quality and size of the rooms, the service, the evening free wine, the overall cost/benefit, and so much more. The only thing that was a tiny bit uncomfortable with our room, it there is just an external sliding frosted glass door that separates the main room from the bathroom, with little soundproofing, so it's best if you're pretty comfortable with your partner, otherwise there could be some embarrassing moments. On check-in, I asked for a room high up, facing the river, and got it. But, the room directly faced a building with the Trump name on it, in very giant letters (surprise!), which unsettled",1
John F,Great downtown location at value price,"The location of the River hotel could not be more perfect. The staff was friendly and the room was spotless. However, we will not be staying there again. We stayed in the upper tower on the 30th floor. It was a hot weekend in Chicago and the AC did not work well at all. We stayed three nights and I did not sleep well b/c I woke up hot multiple times throughout the night. The room would cool better during the day than at night which makes no sense. My husband and I wondered if the hotel had some sort of control over the thermostats at night. Everything else was perfect. If you do not care much about being cool, then this hotel is quite nice!",3
Meander59323016751,loveeeeee this hotel,"Stayed here early July for birthday celebrations. We booked through RCI and specifically selected a room with a waterfront view (called hotel to confirm). The hotel must’ve overbooked because when we checked in, they said that they “upgraded” our room, it was on the 3rd floor with an interior view. Not at ALL what we booked. We called down, and they were sold out that night, however they moved us the next day (moved our luggage for us) to a room on the 7th floor with a fabulous river view! The location is fabulous for tourists. Walking distance to nearly everything!",4
Annabrajkovic,Amazing location - will come back,"We were led to believe a kitchenette suite could sleep four. It certainly could not. The couch cot was so tiny it barely fit my toddler. An adult would not be able to sleep on it, let alone two. We had two adults and a toddler in the room and it felt crowded, partially because of the double bed for us. The bathroom is tiny and does not have a tub. The air didn’t work well in any room (we were with two other couples all on different floors). They kept snacks out last time we were there three years ago, but definitely skimped this time. There were only two pillows on the beds, and the elevators took literally 15 minutes to call. It increased in price but decreased in quality, so it was disappointing overall. Also, we were given a voucher for an upgrade but it was not available",5
Anthony K,Great downtown location for this Club Quarters hotel,Old office building on Wacker just off Michigan Ave that has been converted to a nice hotel.

Location is really unbeatable, I went jogging everyday on Riverwalk whick is amazing, there are restaurants and small shops nearby, also Chicago tours - Big bus tour and Architecture tour are right near to the hotel. What I was also grateful is handwritten name on the envelope in the room with all information with a box of chockate. Loved it! The river view was also so great.

I had a room on the 10th floor with an AMAZING view of the river. I thought I booked a superior room with a kitchenette, but for some rooms that just means a fridge and microwave. I was hoping to cook a few meals, but the Whole Foods was quite a walk, and there’s bougie restaurants everywhere. There was even a yoga mat in my room that I used for stretching and Pilates.

I almost changed my mind about staying here when I read some negative reviews complaining about the room size. Am glad I didn't. Yes, the rooms are small but they are updated and have the basics. One feature I really liked was the free water bottle stations near the elevators. You can grab an empty bottle, fill it and go. No charge like the chain hotels. The fitness center has up to date equipment, including a Peleton bike. There are also laundry facilities available for guests. Free wine and cheese happy hour every day at 5 pm.

I was delighted by the riverside location (albeit a lot of panhandling street people). The staff was gracious and were able to put us in a river front view room on request but it was old and very small. We had to change rooms midway through our stay and they moved us into a bit better room. The restaurant shown on the website is now a block away at the Hilton Garden Inn. There are two other restaurants a step from the door. We ate at the Corner Bakery quite a bit (fresh, quick & inexpensive). The coffee machine in the 2nd floor lounge is nice and the wine hour at 5 pm a pleasant perk. Overall, it is not luxurious but it was worth what they charge and it is convenient.",5
Mary B,Review River Hotel,"The room was small but pleasant. Quiet. I wish the windows has been able to open, and the coffee machine on the 2nd floor did not always work.

There is a great second floor area with coffee and snacks which was really good for the evening and also in the morning where there was fruit and cereal bars in the morning. Our room was quite small and felt like it would be suitable for one person but not so much two people as one side of the bed had no plug sockets or bedside table and there was not much room to get around the bed. The bathroom was ok and nice toiletries. There was a coffee make. There was not a safe in the room. Overall an excellent location but would need to pay more for a better room here I think rather than just book a standard room if you want a really good stay.,3
Erica,Nice Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"One more night and I’m done! If you want food or cleanliness, go elsewhere. The food is through a Seamless account that has not worked for two days in a row. Call the desk for help, as directed, and get told you must be the issue. They have not updated their in-room dining menu to account for the fact that the hotel’s restaurant closed some months ago. There are plenty of wonderful expensive restaurants in the area, but for a businessperson who just wants to eat quickly in the room, no room service is a problem. Seamless is no good if the hotel is the weak link in the chain, I can use my own account! Dirty towels and linens. A lovely man called at 10pm to apologize and offered to send someone up.

Maps31987639992,Loved my stay!,"I'm pretty sure my dorm room was the same size 20 years ago. Shocking this is considered a 4 star. I'd give it 3 for the location and 2 for the room - the shower was a curtain with a tiny lip ledge...how in the world does this get ranked as 4 stars?! The iron and ironing board (which was stained, ripped and old) were kept in the hallway and not even in the room. My view of the concrete wall next door was peaceful. Ugh. The more I write, I can't believe I'm giving you 3 stars. Save your money - book on the gold coast and walk to where you need to be.",3
Renata Jansen,The best location,"My friend and I visited on Memorial Day Weekend. We had the Double/Double room. It was clean, nice and spacious. Our bathrooms were a little small, but the space was well utilized. The room itself was clean and big for hotels in that area. It looked like it had been two rooms with a wall knocked out and a sliding door added. We each had our own bathroom, which was great. The walls were thick and I think that the only time we heard our neighbors were one time when they were coming or going. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known anyone else was around us. The rooms have wireless locks, and there was an option to add it to your phone via the app. I wish I would’ve tried it, but I didn’t. There were also refillable water bottles near the hotel in each floor. The idea was cool and we",4
Tanya S,Excellent choice of hotel,"The hotel’s location is strategic and within walkable distance to millennium park.The room was comfortable and the complementary toiletries were of good quality. We were so lucky and grateful to have the river view room. Love the convenience of the water stations provided. However, I found that complementary coffee was not refilled on some days although it has run out and couldn’t help to notice the dusty charge port , tissue paper box and fittings in the bathroom...the dust remained with us from the first day we checked in until a few days later when we checked out. Surely there’s a checklist in maintaining the quality for housekeeping right ?",5
OhioLaxDad,Quick Overnighter,"Although my stay was only 2 nights, I loved it! My room was clean, large, and had a good view of the city.

Garrett L,Cry Me a River,"We stayed at the River Hotel for 5 nights. The bedroom was very clean, the shower was very good, a bit outdated, but this was not a problem for us.

The building next to it, London House has a beautiful view of the region (go to the rooftop).",3

Keystoneup,Great hotel for a night,"Stayed at the River Hotel on a on night business trip. First, the good - dropped the car with the valet ($53.00 fee) right at the front door, check in was quick and efficient, hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the bed was very comfortable. Location is ideal, the entire city is walkable from here. Now the not so good - the room was microscopic, think cruise ship small, 150 square feet or so. I traveled alone and for only one night so this was not a big deal. Multiple nights or travelling with another person and the room size/bathroom size would be problematic. One of the two elevators was down, leading to long wait times and frequent stops. Room had a coffee maker and hairdryer but the towel quality and limited room furnishings were not top shelf. There was really no",5
maceng-chattan,Good place to stay at a good price,"I stayed at the River Hotel for a night when in Chicago for business. This hotel was fairly average overall. On the plus side, River Hotel offers free snacks and wine. The internet works well, and the lobby has ornate, high-class decor! Unfortunately, this place has some drawbacks too. The rooms are quite tiny and very pricey. One of the elevators was down while I stayed which made for very long trips from my room to the lobby. The beds are not all that comfy. Lastly, I couldn't see any rivers from my room. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, so you could walk to quite a bit of the city from here. Parking is $53/night, so I'd definitely recommend taking public transportation here. There are easily worse hotels out there, but in a city as large as",3

She originally planned on staying with her friend in a nearby hotel, well, her friends flight got cancelled and plans changed the night before our stay. Pedro was incredibly accommodating and helpful I must say! He found us a room the day of, that fit 3 people, with an actual bed for my daughter, not a pull-out or a cot.

We visited with a party of 4 and although we all booked the same room they differ a lot in size. Apparently I had the biggest room with microwave and all (1101) and my colleague the smallest no fridge no microwave (1104). To me not completely fair to pay the same price. Other than the different sizes the rooms are clean, the beds are good and they are well maintained! The location was perfect for us. In good walking distance of the office and all shopping streets like State and Michigan. There were some nice breakfast places around the corner and the bean is also close by.

Pros: - Location is central, right by river north, within walking distance to a lot of the major tourist attractions - Front-desk agents were nice, valet people were nice - Free coffee on the 2nd floor and refillable bottled water on every floor - Friendly cleaning staff/maids - always greeting you, you can tell they work hard - Bed was comfy - Cons: - Small room, the carpets looked dirty, no view - Only 1 elevator working to service 30+ floors. You can imagine the incredibly long waits - No fridge in room, this is the first hotel where I have experienced this",3
Carlo,Nice alternative,"We came to River Hotel after an 8 hours journey from Minneapolis. We made our reservation through Bookings.com. When we attempted to check in we were told that one of our room reservations was missing. After a long discussion we were able to convince the staff that the reservation did exist and was already paid for. When we took our rooms we were shocked to see that we could not see outside--that is how dirty the windows were. One of the rooms had a toilet left with excrement residues. The coffee machine was broken. The heating did not function. When we complained and finally decided to call Bookings.com, we were given the option of 'take it or leave it!' Bookings attempted to redirect us to another hotel some one hour outside of Chicago at a neighborhood called Garfield",5

(cool old post box - for mailing letters - next to the elevators.... and gorgeous architecture throughout!) Mine was only one of two rooms on the 38th floor, with a beautiful view of the river.

Hotel a bit dated and the door staff probably want to be a bit friendlier. First World problems but when you’re paying good money you want the room to be excellent, not average.",1
Woodland42,Good but the rooms are tiny,"This place is great. We stayed in one of the tiny rooms in the tower. The room was well-equipped for the small space. They did a great job of including everything you need in that small space. I would have given them a rating of 5, but the bed wasn't that great. It was comfortable, but if either of us moved, the whole bed shook. Makes for a not-so-great night of sleep if you're not used to that sort of thing. I feel that if they would invest in a better bed, that place would be a 5 for sure. The 2nd floor free coffee and snacks were greatly appreciated. Everything else was spot on.",3

The staff was excellent both when checking in and when I was leaving. I'd definitely stay here again.",4
MariPTravels,Concert with a One Night Stay!,"The best feature of this hotel is its location. It is within walking distance from most major attractions, restaurants and shops. To your left there is a 7-11. To your right there is Corner bakery, a sea food restaurant, a Fannie May, a Starbucks, a protein bar etc. The Magnificent mile, the Millennium park, the Art Institute, the river walk, the 360, the water tower, the lake and the Loop (with street sculptures and theaters) are walking distance from the hotel. The standard room that I stayed in was clean, it had a fridge for your stuff, and filtered water across the elevators. Everything worked just fine. I would say that the hotel and the rooms seem a little tired and out of date. Also, the shower was either too hot or too cold, it was a bit difficult to get the right",5

You can pair your phone with their TV's. It's all very nice. I booked through Greyhound, which I recommend since you don't have to ride the Greyhound in order to book the hotel, and I only paid $150 for 2 nights. One thing to note is that they take a deposit out when you check in. I didn't know that, I assumed that I would just be charged for any fees when I check out. My deposit was for $90. But I immediately got it",2

The room was more than adequate for our needs, the huge queen size bed incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and very clean. The staff were friendly and efficient, nothing seemed to much bother. The location is very good, very easy to get around. It is a shame that the in-hotel restaurant was closed for renovation, but there are plenty of other places to eat in the vicinity. One slight complaint would be the draughty window in the room. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",1
Liubov C,Mini-vacations,"Everything was okay until we decided to leave after a one night stay. We got in the elevator to get our stuff so we could leave.

They were fast to help us get out but the fact is I am traumatized. I can't sleep, I keep having dream I am in a falling elevator. My anxiety is at an all time high! They refunded us but that doesn't give me my piece of mind back or change the fact I am forever traumatized. Getting stuck is one thing, but when you fall not knowing if its going to stop is the worst feeling I have ever had! Also, everything is room was dusty and didn't look clean. The glass",3

The rooms are small, the bathrooms gives you minimum confort and the only positive asppect is the location, at the heart of Chicago and at the beginning of the Magnificent Mile. If you are in a short budget trip, is the kind of hotel you have to choose. If you are looking for something very little better, please choose any other hote in Chicago. It was a poor experience.",4
PageyMoon,Favorite Hotel in Chicago,"I’m just going to come out and say it. The River Hotel is amazing. Great location with an incredible view of the Chicago River, bridges, and skyscrapers. The $10 a night upgrade to a superior room was worth every penny. A super comfortable bed, a mini fridge, a coffee maker, and a microwave were nice surprises. Thank you, Ryan for taking care of me during check in. You made it smooth and easy. The second floor lounge with coffee and snacks was a great bonus, as was the M-Th wine and cheese happy hour from 5-6. All in all, one of my best hotel stays ever. No complaints at all.

The living room with complementary snacks that change throughout the day, espresso drinks, and soda was a very nice perk. There are filtered water stations with refillable bottles throughout the hotel. During the week, there's even complementary wine in the lobby.

EVERYONE in the hotel (staff from top to bottom) is friendly and offers assistance and kindness. Extra credit for the building's historic value! Our only very small negs are difficulty in operating the high-tech TV's (we're not tech savvy, in fairness), and no partition or door between the two bedrooms which seemed a little funky. Still 5 stars, though!!! Flight crews in and out of the place constantly for layovers - what more do you need to know?",5

They had a guest supply closet so you could just grab whatever you needed. At least one airline uses this hotel for their pilots/air crew. Club Quarters Hotel is also in this same building. Up to the 10th floor is the River Hotel and everything above is Club Quarters.

Michigan Avenue and the Mag Mile, yes only a block away, so you can shop, shop, shop. Millennium Park is short walk down Michigan Ave as well with the Art Institute close by.

Our room had no view just a view of a building wall which was disappointing because the area is beautiful. We paid for a queen size bed but got a full size instead. Our didn’t have a microwave or a refrigerator but our friend’s room did and paid the same price.They offer free sodas, coffee, nuts, and m&ms on the second floor but other than that there’s nothing fascinating about the hotel. If you just stay they for a place to stay then this is it but if you want a luxury hotel try the London House next door its gorgeous.",3
PalmsGrillCafe,Great visit,The hotel is in a great location but appears run down .My room on the 11th floor was very small .It was hot .The air conditioner didn’t seem to work .There was a window that faced a wall so there was no natural light .The window didn’t open .The room was shabby .I wouldn’t stay here again .,4

leonurd,older facility but wonderful condition. Great value,"I just returned from a three night stay in Chicago to attend the Opera and the Symphony. This hotel checked all the boxes: it was clean, comfortable, convenient, and appropriately priced. If I return to Chicago, I would stay here again.",3
Odyssey46713911294,A great place to stay,"We stayed at the River Hotel for a quick getaway to the City. Great, friendly staff. Good room. Great location. We received complimentary upgrade which was an unexpected, but very nice, surprise. I really liked the hotel's ""Guest Services"" closest found on the floor just down the hall from our room. It was stocked with irons, ironing boards, extra bedding/pillows. Great idea.",3
Ryan H,"The pictures ""look"" great...",The River Hotel staff were very accommodating. The valet was reasonably priced and we really liked that the concierge checked our bags in before our room was ready. The rooms were clean and comfortable for two people. The location was perfect and within walking distance of many great shops and restaurants. We will return!,5
Kathy52r,Nice hotel,"Near the Chicago river, near great shopping and restaurants. Rooms are a tad small but very well appointed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Comfortable common room on second floor, Really great restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5
Tee S,Honeymooners,A great place to stay. Walking distance to many places in downtown Chicago and right across from an entrance to the River walk. You can't beat that. For my first visit to Chicago I couldn't have picked a better place to stay for the price.,3
wooleynuts969,Excellent location for visiting the city,"Let me start this off by saying that Andrei, the manager, was awesome. If it weren't for him and his customer service, this review would have been one star. Before I begin my review, let me give you a pro tip: There are 4 elevators when you walk into the River Hotel, 2 on the left and 2 on the right. The 2 on the right service floors 1-11 and the ones on the left 12-top floor. Unbeknownst to us, they're renovating floors 12-top floor.. so to save yourself headaches, construction workers everywhere and the tiny rooms (more on that below) ask to be moved to floors 1-11 which will require an upgrade fee or better yet just stay at the Wynham which is right next to this hell hole for around the same price of their ""upgraded rooms"". I don't even know where to begin with this.",2
Guilherme Leite Camargo,Totally worth it,Anna Hampson (manager) was very helpful. She was very responsive and quickly resolved an issue we had. The location of the hotel is excellent and provided easy access to many points of interest. The small restaurant next door to the hotel was excellent for breakfast.,1
grlskas,"Great Location, Great Amenities very accommodating and friendly","My husband and I are so excited to honeymoon at River Hotel. The impetus of our stay started off wonderfully. The front desk rep was really fast, personable and informative. We soon found out about Free Wine and Cheese at 5 pm and also the 2nd floor full of snacks and refreshments. Our room is located on the 6th floor. Upon checking out the view, I noticed the first issue... Cracked paint across the ceiling. I wouldn't expect something like this in a 4 star hotel... maybe a 3 star like Holiday Inn. Also, whomever installed the coat hanger obviously did not use a ruler! (check out the included pics) Then, I noticed that the room was ""gently cleaned,"" as there is a lot of dust and a few dings on the wood furniture. The mirrors in the bathroom have pre-existing finger",3
shortysboyKansas,Great room at the top!,At the heart of the city and the best cross roads to head to everything. Overlooks the river but is not noisy Clan and very friendly staff Attched restaurant has just closed but good options a coiulpe of doors away. No safe was our only surprise,4
Dreamer284125,Wonderful boutique hotel in a great location,"The place it well located, clean and organized. The staff are very friendly as well. Taxis in front ate the hotel most of the day and night. A nice bakery just beside the hotel and have nice food. A wallgreens just next block after the river and 5 min walk from magnificent mile.",5
Stephanie M,Weekend trip to Chicago,"We spent two evenings here, it is a great location for walking around Chicago. I would ask for a room facing the front of the hotel. This is co-located with the Club Quarters Hotel (one on each side). They have a nice Happy Hour get together for the guests. Fresh water station on each floor, comfortable rooms, but somewhat small. It worked great for two of us. I would stay here again.",3
marylr2015,Wonderful family getaway,"We were here only one night but the room made it very memorable. The top floors only have a few room and the views are incredible. The neighboring hotel was being picketed by noisy, kind of obnoxious, hotel union folks who were making enough noise we heard them in the morning and we were 30plus stories high. Despite that noisy inconvenience beyond the River Hotel’s control- we had a great time! The lobby bar had good drinks and really good wings! The bed was very comfy and everything clean and fresh. The staff were great and very helpful and friendly. We would recommend to any couples!",3
DJW41,"Great location, friendly staff!",This boutique hotel was excellent. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The train is a few blocks away and it takes you right to the airport. This was great because the traffic to the airport is terrible. Will definitely staff here again next time in downtown Chicago.,5
RealtOr30,Great Location!,I love the river hotel! The location is perfect and centrally located. The views are amazing. The price is very reasonable. Staff are great and make the stay much easier and so wonderful. I won’t stay anywhere else in Chicago!,5
Heather N,Comic con,"My parents and my daughters and I stayed for 3 nights. The location was fantastic! Directly across the street from the River and a block away from miracle mile. The room was WONDERFUL. We had 3 separate areas. One with a king bed and TV and one with a queen bed and tv and then a sitting area with a TV and queen sleeper sofa. There were also 2 separate baths, a small kitchen and eating area. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were roomy. It was lovely and I would definitely stay again",3
Anybody1970,Great stay,"Spent a weekend at the River Hotel and thought it was great. Hotel was clean with classic old school hotel look. The staff was fantastic. Rooms were small (typical of older city hotels) and there isn't a hotel bar, but there's plenty of places nearby. Overall, great hotel choice and I would definitely stay at the River Hotel when I'm back in Chicago.",2
mmtomato,"Tiny rooms, slow elevator","Boutique hotel across from the River walk and close to many of Chicago’s attractions. Helpful staff, our room wasn’t ready at the guaranteed time so we got upgraded, without even asking. Nice room with tv, coffee and toiletries. On the 2nd floor there are snacks and complimentary wine at happy hour. Enjoyed our stay and check out was fast! Reasonably priced rooms.",1

Chinse T,Perfect location,"The rooms are tiny, the decor is spartan, and the elevator service is frustratingly slow. We left after one night, never to return. Location is good, and price was low, but there are better options. Trip Advisor is asking for additional characters in the description, but the above accurately covers our poor experience at this property.",5
Sharon W,Great Staff,This hotel is in the heart of Chicago with all the main attractions within walking distance of the hotel. Check in was quick and staff were helpful and friendly. The room was slightly small but the bed was very comfortable and the shower was big with strong power and hot water. On Floor 2 tea/coffee and soft drinks were readily available and wine was on offer from 5-6pm daily. Each floor has reusable water bottles and cool water which was needed in the hot weather. My highlight of the hotel was returning home with clean laundry following the free use of a washing and drying machine!,3
satsb007,Extremely disappointing,"In March, Chicago was near freezing but staying here was hot. The location was amazing, the front desk staff were very personable, the onsite fitness room was great and the views were delightful during sunrise and sunset. If I were looking to splurge. I’d certainly stay here again.",3
Heather H,Weekend Birthday Trip,This hotel was the perfect location for my short stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. They gave me a room with the river view and held my luggage after I had checked out. I would stay here again.,5

Thank you to everyone at the River Hotel for helping to make our stay so wonderful!",2

phred0069,Security Alert,This hotel has a superb location right on the Chicago river. We had a room on the 23rd floor which had a nice view of the city. The only negative would be the room doors which are not very soundproof.,3
travelingal12,Loved this hotel..when I finally found it!,"The misses and I were just in Chicago for a quick weekend and could not have been happier with the River Hotel. We just needed a bed and wanted to be able to get around downtown as easily as possible. From check-in to check-out (and baggage hold) it was just what we needed. Super easy in-out off of Wacker, on the river, a block to Michigan Ave, a block to all major bus lines. It is a great home base for a quick trip. *Bonus points for the free bottled water*",4
Connector72007,US holidays,Great location! Got the one bedroom suite and it was HUGE. Staff was friendly and attentive. Room was clean and I couldn't hear anything from next door. Restaurant downstairs was also convenient. Will definitely be returning.,5
Brenda B,Decent room but a bit on the small side,"It sucks because the hotel itself was fine...Rooms were perfect. Location was perfect. But the staff...please lock your valuables inside. My bags were both ransacked and items were missing. Only ppl who accessed my room were me, my other half and room attendant. This was verified by the hotel staff themselves. They tried to make me feel stupid. No room safes. Please do not leave things in room!!!",3
bgibson198d,FIRST-CLASS!,"We walked from the train stain, and got to West Wacker easily. I thought going in a straight line would lead you to East Wacker- no so. It leads to East Wacker BLVD! Finally found it, and it's in the same location as the Club Quarters Hotel, you just take the right elevators instead of the left ones. After getting in our room, we found it was everything we wanted except for the kitchenette had no cutlery or dishes. I understand that comes with a room with a kitchen (not a kitchenette). So they responded quickly and brought what we required, but then had to ask for dish soap and a sponge...Aside from that, it's a beautiful, clean a comfortable place to stay and central to everything.",3
Karuna_AE,Perfect location,"Big thumbs up. This hotel had it all. Highly recommend. Perfect location, service, comfort & price met all expectations. Staff was very helpful and local knowledge of the area was great. Will definitely stay again.",5
Curiosity812005,Awesome weekend getaway!,"Great location. Right in the heart of the city. A decent room and clean but a bit on the small side for the price. There is quite a wait for the elevator at times but on a positive note, they do have their own valet parking there which is helpful.",5
Joe F,"Great Location, but......","Amazing. Staff was BEYOND helpful. Friendly, courteous, you name it. Right in the middle of it all, my wife and I didn't want to leave. Room was cozy, nice big TV to watch college football in our limited down time. We can't wait to come back!",3
Christoph R,location,1. Took the CTA from the airport and the hotel is walking distance from the blue line station 2. Right on the river and opens up to stunning views of downtown 3.

Chainey47nz,Great Location,"I stayed here for a weekend with one of my friends & really enjoyed this hotel! I would definitely stay here again & really recommend it! This hotel is in the PERFECT location! Right on the river, close to magnificent mile & just blocks away from the “L” & great restaurants! Also had great views of the river from our room! The rooms are small, but I don’t really spend much time in the rooms, so that was no problem! Also, Pedro the receptionist was awesome! We arrived early morning before check in time, & to check into room early, it cost $50, but since we weren’t sure on what to do, he let us check in early to our room free of charge! Really appreciate the customer service from him! Can’t wait to stay here again!",1
TribalVal,Right in the heart of Chicago!,"You will see in many reviews of this hotel saying that it has a great location. It is true. In fact, it maybe in one of the best location in downtown Chicago. Centrally located between Grant Park and the start of the magnificent mile. Across the street from the River, 1/2 block from Michigan Ave, 6 blocks from the lake, and 6 blocks from the L. BTW - the staff was great, room / hotel clean and well maintained. Also, happy hour and snacks. However, the rooms are small. I would not recommend if you are trying to put your family in one room. If you do not mind a small room then this is a great value for one of the best locations in Chicago.",3

Ruth K,Great location-river view a plus-friendly and helpful staff,"The reservation promissed a queen bed which does not exist for double rooms and had to pay extra for a suite. After an awful first night in an extremely uncomfortable bed. The suite was better and thanks to the excellent attention and service from Pedro at reception. As good as Pedro was at his job, rarely have we seen a less helpful and rude hotel receptionist than Diego. He did not even bother to check if our room was taken when we requested a late check out. Given we had stayed 3 nights in the hotel and upgraded to a suite, he simply said we would have to pay $ 30 for a late check out and even more if we wanted to stay beyond 2 pm. He seemed to enjoy giving the bad news and smiled sardonically. All we wanted was an extra 1 hour! The hotel itself is excellently located and",3
bangbang-one,Tremendous Experience,"Would stay again & would recommend great location we walked to Millennial park, close to river front activities. Close to Train station close to Garrets for popcorn & Giordano's famous pizza YUM!!Its nice they also offer free water bottles to fill & reuse on each floor.They have free snacks on the second floor & complimentary wine in evening.",3
Sarah J,"Great location, big space, amazing pizza place attached","I stayed at the River Hotel with my Wife, Mother, and Aunt. We all enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, had a fridge, and they even include a water dispenser with bottles outside the elevator which was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and accommodating. They also provide a wine happy hour where they provide free glasses of wine so the guests can mingle with one another. We stayed here mainly for the location to Millennium Park(10 min walk) and the River Walk(Steps away). I would recommend staying here!",5
Lauranorthshore,Perfect location,"Great location-view of Chicago river from corner windows was worth every penny! A plus was the sidewalk restaurant, the near location for tour bus pickup for seeing all of Chicago, and the river walk.",5
Antony G,Great Location to get to everything this Amazing City has to offer,"We arrived at the hotel at 10am intending to drop off our bags and hit the streets to shop before seeing Hamilton but were extremely surprised to be able to check into our room early...and they waived the early check-in fee as I had posted a ""like"" on facebook! We booked the two bedroom suite and it was great...separate bedrooms (with a sliding door) and 2 1/2 bathrooms. Large, clean and the new TV's were great! Location was close to everything - CIBC theater, Navy Pier, Michigan Ave shopping, everything Chicago can offer! Elevators were fast. Staff was friendly and helpful. Free water and wine...what more could you ask..all at a great rate!",3
Alison H,Great hotel,"The hotel were helpful pre booking to clarify which room type would be best, the room was great, the bathrooms more than adequate, the space was great for us as a family, not sure it would suit two couples as no doors separating the spaces (apart from bathrooms) The location was incredible, right opposite Trump tower and perfect for walking to almost everywhere we needed. The building is very narrow and tall so understandable that there was very little natural light, but we were really only there for sleeping so wasn't an issue. the lift isn’t not the quickest. The refreshments on second floor were handy, not the biggest choice, but coffee and fruit available, wasn't told about this on check in so didn’t discover it for a few days. LOVED the water bottles and filling station by",2
Janesays_11,Great,Stayed here for 2 nights. Absolutely amazing. Free wine tasting from 5pm and nibbles available all day. On your room level they have free water bottles which you can fill with filtered water - great idea and should be implemented everywhere. Lobby where you check in was more like a small room which I wasn’t sure if that’s where you check in. Overall I would highly recommend this place and would stay again,1
Brian P,Awesome hotel location.,"Centrally located in downtown. Easy to access trains, taxis, kayaks, or just walk around. Everything this amazing city has to offer is at your fingertips. The new Riverwalk area is across the street. The only issue is looking at the Trump sign across the street.",3
Julie Duffy,Awesome!,"From the time we check in nothing was a problem,we were early and were prepared to leave our bags. Our room was ready and they were happy for us to book in. Snacks and hot and cold drinks on 2 floor no charge,guest laundry no charge everything about this hotel is for the travelers.",4
Alvaro Joao P,Location perfect.,Really enjoyed this hotel. Let bed the cement spires that hung over our windows- in picture. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Room is super quiet. Couldn’t hear a peep from the hallway and we were right next to the elevator on the 6th floor. Hallways have purified water and bottles there to refill. Staff does a free wine and snacks time at 5 pm. There is also an espresso machine on the 2nd floor that appears to be self service and free. Yoga mat and exercise bands in the room and fitness videos available on TV. Needed maintenance to come up Cuz we thought the fridge was broken and he came up immediately and was super nice about it. It just wasn’t plugged in. We learned on the architecture tour (highly recommend after dark) that this bldg was constructed in 1928 and is the,5
mfjayhawk,Misleading Website Offer,We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnati’s. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.,3
hazboy66,Wonderful experience at the River Hotel,"We were in Chicago for a long weekend and stayed at the River Hotel, which is very convenient to many attractions.

bettylouwarmington,Size Matters,"For our purposes, the location was perfect. All of the city's main attractions were just a few blocks from the hotel. Ideal for people who like to walk to know the place. Nearby you will find options for quick meals and also good options for enjoying the walks beside the river.",5
JasonNewf1973,Great Location!,"Just a quick FYI. I made a 3 night reservation for this hotel on the hotel direct website and was teased with the offer of a free room upgrade. I clicked to accept the offer and was told it would be added following reservation. Made the reservation and got the upgrade offer stating I would be upgraded after I added my travel plans to my social media. I don't do much social media and would never post planned out of town travel there so I called the hotel and was informed without the social media post I would not get the room upgrade. I cancelled the reservation. You may not find this offer a problem, but I didn't like additional conditions added after the fact or that I would announce to everyone my home is empty during my trip.",5
Katie K,Family weekend at Loyola,"We checked in for one night stay and asked for a 1pm check in (normal check-in is 3pm) and Pedro at the front desk was more than helpful. Besides being friendly and helpful about nearby attractions, he gave us a complimentary upgrade, which landed being the room on the 41st floor....and also the only room AND the highest room in the hotel. The top four floors are in a tower which give a 360 degree view of the entire area. The views are breathtaking up there. The entire staff was so helpful and courteous. They have valet parking (prices are comparable to other hotel in downtown Chicago) and you are about a 20-30 minute from the Navy Pier, Millennium Park and the John Hancock Center. There is a restaurant on the ground floor but if you just want a coffee and some fruit or a",3

Nice service. Close to the river. Personal service, which is different frim the larger hotels. We didn't eat here, but heard people are very pleased with the restaurant. The rooms are definitely what I would call ""Chicago city rooms"", smaller, but perfect for what we needed. I would definitely stay there again.",3
MITravelFam,Great Location. Ok hotel.,"Arrived at the hotel at 2 pm. Our first trip to Chicago so we were a bit anxious. With GPS, hotel was easy enough to find. As we pulled up, Valet was there to guide us and help us with our luggage. Valet parking was $50+ per day. We had them secure our vehicle for two days. Expensive but I guess, necessary. Check in was quick, staff was friendly and helpful. They were able to get us in our room right away even though check in was at 3 pm. Location of the hotel is very convenient. Everything was in walking distance, including popular attractions, museums, restaurants and bars. Our room was small but adequate for the two of us.

buzmar86,close to everything,"The location at the river, steps from Riverwalk and walking distance to the Loop, Magnificent Mile and River North, is about the only redeeming quality. Check-in quality was inconsistent, with my agent failing to inform me of the features of the hotel such as the gym, wine hour and coffee/snacks on the 2d floor, but I overheard the other agent briefing another guest. The old and small elevators in the old building take forever to service 41 floors. I did not expect a river view but the “city view” from my 17th floor room was more like “frat row view” consisting of empty beer bottles on a ledge. The yoga mat in the closet was a nice touch but the room was so small it was impossible to work out without lifting furniture on the bed. Linens were plush, bed was comfortable and the",5

When we decided to upgrade to a bigger room, the hotel quickly made it happen and the upgrade charge was more than reasonable, cheap in fact. When we checked out, I left a shirt hanging in the closet and they sent it to me! We absolutely loved our trip to Chicago and plan on returning. The River Hotel is where we'll stay every time. Lovely place, and close to absolutely everything.",1

The room was very comfortable except looking out the window and seeing nothing but a cement wall. The carpet in the room was a bit dirty but otherwise no complaints at all with this hotel and the location. The only reason I didnt rate it a 5 was getting a view of the wall. At least some descriptions could be included like ""no view"" when booking, or maybe they gave us the least desirable room to give the better rooms to other people. Otherwise I would consider the hotel again but would ask not to be put in a",4

There were fingerprint marks around every light switch, scuff marks on the walls, worn carpet. The window looked out to a brick wall about 20 inches away. My floor had",3
Jack F,Some things right... so many things wrong,"I booked the River Hotel based on previous reviewers opinions and location. Room rates in Chicago are rather high, ( like any world city) so cost was a big factor, but luckily I was sharing with a friend. RH offers double queen rooms with two separate areas to sleep as well as each having its own bathroom & TV. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Beds had nice crisp, clean white linens, with an ample choice of fluffy pillows. The location is ideal for everything there is to see & do all that Chicago has to offer.Great proximity to the theatre district, Grant Park, Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The staff were pleasant, friendly, and knowledgable. A really great choice for the business & leisure traveler.",3
Cindy S,Large Group Stay,"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks: - Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights. - In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price ($52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options. - Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors. -Lounge with complimentary",5
730chitown,Many Better Hotels in Chicago,"We had a great experience from the time we pulled up outside the hotel. Valet took our car, we got a great room with a view (always ask for a view-it’s beautiful!), & it was complementary wine hour when we arrived! We even booked an extra night because we enjoyed our stay so much. I asked for an extra blanket before bed & I got on the elevator and went to my room & they were there at the door waiting to give me the blanket. I was super impressed with the friendly and efficient employees. They were always willing to help if we needed anything and suggested fun things to do in the area. I will definitely stay here every time I stay in Chicago!",5
TravellerAtWill,Can't argue with the location - can't shower with praise,"The building looks beautiful; the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area. 2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too. 3. No ironing board! 4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky. 5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on. 7. The",3
awes0meayres0me,Fabulous Hotel!,"The River Hotel was the perfect location for our large group stay yesterday evening. The hotel manager, Anna was professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful! We loved the entire staff including Pedro and Sierra at the front desk. It was located conveniently to all of the iconic spots we visited in Chicago and the gorgeous River Walk was right across the street.. an awesome view! We felt safe and very well taken care of and I can’t wait to stay there again on my next visit to the Windy City!",2
roxy3010,Very nice,Rooms are small and overpriced. Lack of amenities. Beds are uncomfortable. Skimp on the linens in the bathroom. Seems to be a small hotel that they tried to update but failed pretty badly at doing.If you are coming to Chicago I can think of many other hotels to try instead of this one.,1
Ben H,Avoid the valet parking service,"River is not surprisingly right on the river, so you're within reach of a whole host of restaurants, bars, shops and attractions. I was there for business, with clients in the Wrigley Building across the bridge. The Trump tower is opposite, with his name splattered all over the side. That's a bit garish, but if you like to be surrounded by unique architecture, it's a great place to be. The hotel is a bit dated, but the rooms are okay - but for the bathroom. I'll get to the rooms, but let's talk about the lobby and... actually getting to the rooms. The doorman was a bit useless - often not realising I was there, standing in front of me as I tried to enter and just plodding about. I asked him if there was a store near by to grab a newspaper and some candy... he silently",3
Nikki H,Way overpriced for the value,"I stayed here for 5 nights around July 4th with my 2 adult daughters and it's hard to express how good we thought the hotel was for the price in a short review. It's right in the heart of Chicago, opposite Trump Tower (which makes it easy to find your way back to - look for Trump Tower and walk that way!). The hotel is within easy walking distance of most of the main attractions, including Magnificent Mile, the river walk, Navy Pier and the lake front, Millenium Park and the Cloud, Willis Tower and the Art Institute, and just around the corner from a CTA station for trips further afield (although the only time we used public transport was for my trip to Wrigley Field). We paid a little extra for rooms with kitchenettes, which was worth it for the extra space. Thr rooms were kept",4
Mortaric,Perfect location,"Stayed here for 5 nights, had a lovely trip. The room was very small but enough space for 2. Could have done with a bit more storage for cloths so we wasn't living out of our case. Good central location. Complimentary tea, coffee and water and snacks throughout the day. Would stay here again.",5
Jean E,Our Refuge,Really average room but the bed was comfortable. The really bad thing was the valet parking...they were pretty slow but that's understandable when it's busy. What wasn't understandable was them stealing my phone mount and charger out of my car.,3
Bryce B,Great Stay,"The rooms are very small. Hotel offers no free breakfast and you must pay for valet parking. There were no microwaves in the room or common area. The tv in our room did not work. It served its purpose of being a safe place to sleep, but was NOT worth the $170/night I paid for a romantic weekend that ended in lots of PB&J because we couldn't afford breakfast..",3
NZSailfish,Great location and service,"Very centrally located, good value. Next to the Wyndham Hotel. No parking, but there are affordable lots within a 5-7 minute walk. Free wifi, complimentary wine at 6pm, 2nd floor complimentary snacks and coffee. Nice decor, friendly staff. Elevators are slow. Rooms are small, as is the window, but room enough for 2 people. Window view is nice. No room safe. Air conditioning is nice and cold and quiet. Bathroom is small but nice with well working shower drain and shower head. Overall great experience and would recommend it.",5
Familyof5ohio,Friendly staff and fantastic location,"I have always loved the River Hotel and can't imagine staying anywhere else. The rooms are simply beautiful, the beds are exactly what we needed after a long day in the heat, and breakfast at Bella Bacino's is always a treat . Another highlight is that we're walking distance from Miracle Mile, the Art Institute, and Millenium Park. And my personal favorite...the River Walk. Stay here for simplicity, comfort, and location.",5

BryanW52,"Great location, comfortable room","As many others have stated, this hotel is located near everything you would need or want to visit. When we arrived we had trouble with the TV turning itself off. I called reception and there was a maintenance man at the door within 5 minutes. We also enjoyed the snacks and coffee available on the 2nd floor as well as the complimentary wine hour each evening. Every staff member we came into contact with was professional, smiling and polite. I highly recommend this hotel to others.",2
Juliazora,Just ok,"The River Hotel lives up to its name as it is just across the street from the river and steps from Michigan Avenue. Very convenient to walk to the Magnificent Mile, the Loop, the theaters, and pretty much any central Chicago location. Easy access to the riverwalk, too. The front desk was friendly and accommodating, check in and check out was a breeze, and the valet staff and housekeeping staff were also pleasant. The coffee/tea/snacks were a nice touch, though I wish they would offer more of a continental breakfast, but there are cafes and coffee shops everywhere. Our suite was perfect for our family - two separate sleeping areas (no doors, but dividing walls), plus a pull-out sofa, and BEST of all - two full bathrooms (this is a must with five people). Our room was clean",1
trevnju,Great City...Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while in town for a birthday weekend. This hotel was in a great location--close to restaurants and attractions ( Mag Mile, the bean,etc). This is the first time I've been to this chain of hotel, a few really cute added touches like the snacks and drinks on the 2nd floor! Only downside would be that there were only 2 elevators for floor 11- 42. You can imagine the wait/how crowded the elevator was. Sometimes it took us 8- 10 mins just to get on the elevator.",3
Robert F,Great location!,"A historic building in a great location by the river and handy for the Loop, city centre and all amenities and attractions. Popular with business people, airline staff and tourists. We stayed for five five days in a small but adequate room. Facilities were good - laundry, guest lounge with free beverages and snacks, on-site bistro. Slightly quirky elevator system due to the building housing two premises - The River Hotel and the Club Quarters members hotel. One of the highlights was the daily free wine tasting from 5-6pm!",4
Eitanrais,Great Hotel,"The room, bathroom, and view of the river were tiny. For $300/night. I expected more. The shower was actually spacious. The elevator took so long to get to us during busy checkout time that we took the stairs from the 11th floor. Our TV never worked but we didn't report it because we didn't spend much time in the room.",5

David J,Happy,I had an excellent stay at the River Hotel in Chicago last week. The staff was very attentive to your needs and extremely friendly. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. It was a little difficult to find at first and people didn't seem to know the hotel when I said the name of it. Apparently a very well kept secret in the city.,1

It had points of interest (Grant park, Chicago 360, theaters, restaurants..) within easy We had asked for an upgrade to a larger queen room so we could have a refrigerator and view of the river.Ironically the ""larger"" queen room is without a doubt the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in, although clean and quiet.",1
Tom L,Excellent Stay,"When my work messed up and didn't get me booked in Hotel Monaco where my meeting is being held, this is what they came up with. Instead of window seats overlooking the city (Hotel Monaco), my closet-of-a-room is a rather dingy looking, windowless, hear everything going on in the hallway and rooms around you situation, complete with coffee stained info card sitting on the bed . . .

I called again and spoke with someone at front desk and was asked to call management again and that the housekeeper went home for the day. Never got a call back from anyone. I must Have called 11 times each time was asked to give a description of the jacket and was told something different evrytime.

Rosie B,"Brilliant Location, Excellent Value","My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is",5
lois1232018,Great location,Anna and the service staff are top notch in all respects. Caring is the best word to use. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The 5:00 complimentary wine served in the lobby was an added bonus which made you feel like family. The location is spot on for the many attractions and allows those who like to walk like us to do so. The Big Bus (hop on and off) starts and finishes right across the street. We drove our vehicle and used the valet parking. It was obvious that our CRV was treated well. This was our first time visiting Chicago. It was amazing thanks in part to our choice of the River Hotel.,3
jen11142018,Nice getaway!,"This hotel is in a perfect location. A short walk to the magnificent mile, Mellium park. The train is a short walk away that will take you to Wrigley Field, Lincoln park zoo. The hotel staff are awesome. So helpful. Nice clean hotel.",3
timdanzoo,Visit to Chicago,"We booked a superior room as previous reviews had suggested that the classic rooms were a little small, we got a good sized room with a sofa, desk, fridge and microwave. The bathroom had a walk-in shower, rather than a bath-which suited us fine. We also had a great view across the river. Everything worked, good wi-fi, huge TV. Check-in was quick and efficient. The location is perfect for a city break, most sights are within walking distance, good access to trains and buses. The hotel doesn't have its own restaurant but the attached restaurant does good food and there are plenty of other eateries nearby. The staff were, without exception, really friendly and helpful. This is somewhere I'd happily return to, and will recommend to friends.",5

Although, I pre-paid for the stay in The River hotel, they cancelled my booking without even notifying or refunding me. When I finally got in the hotel they were not willing to give me any room and was blaming me that my (paid!) room was cancelled. Finally after a long discussion I managed to get a room with no windows. I would not recommend anyone booking this hotel.",4
wangjay819,Average,The hotel gave me a room according to my request/ preference. The room was on the higher floor and facing to the river. The check-in process was very quick and simple. The location was superb as it is situated right in the down town area and close to any public transportation. Easy access from the O'Hare Airport. Just take L train (Blue line) from Airport train station and get off at Washington station (45-50 minutes) and take another 10 to 15 minutes walk to the Hotel. Will definitely comeback to this hotel again if travelling to Chicago Overall : EXCELENT !!,5

Phip00,Hotel is fine.,"This was our first visit to Chicago and we couldn’t have chosen a better location, which for us was the main selling point of this hotel. As the name suggests it’s opposite the river (where you can get boat trips), just around the corner from the Magnificent Mile and The Loop, a short walk from Millenium Park, and there are views of the Wrigley building and the Chicago Tribune Tower from the front of the hotel. The staff members are friendly, polite and helpful, the coffee and snacks available (free of charge) are a bonus, however the Club class rooms are very small and nothing special so it would definitely be worth upgrading - depending on the cost of course! Would definitely stay here again.",3

Missie S,Nice hotel!,Stayed here for 4 nights. The room is basic. Its the location your paying for! It’s in between the miracle mile and the bean! Before starting the day we got coffee from Stan’s donuts which is a 7 minute walk!,5
Gretchen B,I WILL STAY AGAIN!,"Located in the heart of downtown Chicago this hotel was a great place to stay. Great rooms, good WiFi, fab views in a vibrant riverside area. The breakfast was good with friendly and quick services. Other cafes and restaurants also close by.",5
kthorstenson1,Excellent Customer Service,"Wonderful staff and service! Everyone was friendly and hospitable. My room was small, but comfortable.The view was amazing! The TV didn't always work and when I first got there the room smelled a bit like BO. The elevators also took some time. The free wine night was my favorite part!",3
azujewski,Weekend in Chicago,"Great hotel across from the river and the Trump hotel. Walking distance to so much! Snacks available in the day, wine at night! Pull out couch was So comfy and it’s a pullout. 😀 easy to grab a cab out the door! Terrific good nearby!",2
Anne M,"Great Staff. Excellent Location, Will Stay Again!","My favorite thing about this hotel was the location. IT'S PERFECT! The room we'd got was so small, but we didn't care cause we were there just at night, so it was ok. Our only problem was with the heat, they have the temperature set and you cannot change it neither open the window, so at night it was SO HOT. Excellent costumer service!",1
stephanie d,One of the best,Natasha was incredible in managing a need that I had. I am very thankful to her and the staff for making accommodations. Thank you so much for a great experience. I look forward to many stays at this hotel because of the incredible customer service.,3
Ames S,Exceeded my expectations!,"Location was walking distance to EVERYTHING we planned on going to (besides Lagunitas brewery which is 20 min ride outside downtown). Located right on the river, for a great price (but also visited in February in a pretty low-demand period I'd imagine). Interior plus the lobby area for continental breakfast, desk space, etc was all really classy",4
xstaceyleighx,Great value in a superb location!,"This was my first time staying at the River Hotel and I will definitely be back! The staff at this hotel, in particular Seth at the check in counter, were extremely friendly and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable! A big thank you to Seth who checked my friend and I in earlier than expected and then helped us find some great restaurants and attractions to see. Nothing was too hard for the staff at this hotel and it was greatly appreciated. We booked a small room but it met our needs. Beds were comfy, everything was very clean and we were overall extremely happy with it. Location was fantastic! Very close to everything Chicago has to offer. Absolutely would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Chicago! Thanks River Hotel, I'll be back!",5
Marion F,Good location with great extras,"Perfectly situated in downtown Chicago this hotel just gets better, although the rooms are not huge they are perfect, great fresh coffee machine in the room, complimentary coffee in the club room and free wine tasting between 5 and 6. The wifi is great complimentary printer and the icing on the cake after a long trip, the free guest laundry. We stayed on the 38th floor, great view and well worth the 15 dollar upgrade. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, fantastic and tje staff are wonderful",3
Jenny M,Okay stay - good location,"I'm actually still here, laying on my bed writing this. I've stayed at hotels around the world and am mostly disappointed... but this little hotel has exceeded my expectations. Small room has everything I need. Extremely comfy bed, soft sheets, great pillows. HUGE flat screen tv, free bottled water and cappuccinos. Walking distance to absolutely everything, attentive staff... under $100 per night! Can't wait to come back.",3
PaulLondonTraveller,Great location. Comfortable room. Good facilities,"This Hotel is situated in great location, a 5 minute walk from the Magnificent Mile, all the major shops and designers, within walking distance of both the Lincoln Park Zoo and the Navy Pier and the famous Millennium Park. It is definitely the most convenient location to stay and it was great value for money in the month of January. The rooms were a little outdated, but very clean and spacious. Extras and amenities such as a Hair Dryer, toiletries and a purified water cooler on most floors. The staff were very helpful and friendly and went the extra mile to provide assistance, such as information on places to eat, maps and our room was ready even earlier than expected. If I were to visit Chicago again, I would definitely stay here and can recommend the Wildberry Pancakes & Café",5
weightofzero,Great hotel.,"A less than 10 minute walk to every train line, it was a great location with the same walking distance to the mile and millennium park. The real highlight of the hotel was the guest common area, it came with 2 computers a printer, tv and snacks like fresh and dried fruit, canned sodas, granola bars and a coffee machine available until 9pm.",5
Latricia21,Small Room with Good Location,"Because I was spoiled by another hotel the previous month at another location, it may have impacted the way I felt about this hotel. The restaurant attached to the hotel was not desirable - the food was not good. While the staff was amazing, the rooms were super small and smelled stale & damp. The bed was not as comfortable to me this trip so I was not very rested for work. Not the worse stay, but not the best stay. Oh, and there were REALLY LOUD people. Oh my gosh. They kept me up past midnight. I had to open the door and tell people to be quiet at 2 am... Thin walls?",3
Michigan835,Great location great price,"This is a Club Quarters Hotel so comes with the usual communal lounge to chill out or work in. Has a coffee machine with good latte (real beans!) as well as a normal one in your room. Unlimited M&Ms (always a bonus), mixed savoury snacks, nuts, wasabi snacks, dried bananas and seeds. Plus fresh fruit. They also put our cereal bars in the morning and nachos & salsa in the evenings. So nice added touch. Room was big enough and comfortable. Clean bathroom plus a desk and chair in the room. Not a lot of draw space (2) but a shelf in the wardrobe top. Iron and iron board available along with extra bedding in the communal closet. Filtered water stations with bottles on every floor. So you save a fortune in bottle water. Which is handy. Location is south of the river directly",2
carlos l,Pedro my Man,"Stayed here with wife for a weekend in December '17. Was a bit leery after reading some of the reviews but one of these days I'll learn my lesson in regards to that since most people since the advent of Yelp think they are some sort of self-styled tastemaker. Location: perfect. Right on the Chicago River. Our room had a great view of the marina towers and unfortunately a better view of the Trump tower. The size of the room was a bit on the smaller side but that's to be expected when you are staying at an old building which was obviously converted/modernized at some stage. Saw a lot of complaints about the elevator on here. Sure it's old (again, old building) but over the course of four days we only had to wait on it once for over 4 minutes. It was a hellish and life",1
sdaley77,River Hotel - Great centralized location!,"The price was right. The location was great. The room was really small. Staff was great, special thanks to Adrianna in house keeping. Over all we would stay here again but maybe in the summer when we have less baggage.",3
Nicole R,Wonderful people work here,"We stayed here, pre-paid room and got a great deal. It is close to everything we wanted to see, which was lucky because January in Chicago is brutal! Some sort of problem retrieving our car at check out, but hotel manager refunded 1 night of parking charge for the inconvenience, without us even asking. We would definitely stay there again!",4
