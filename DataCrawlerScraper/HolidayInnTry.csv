arsw1,Warm hospitality,"I had a good experience staying in this hotel. The front desk staffs are helpful and willing to listen. Staff member Reena is patient and willing to go the extra mile to accomodate us. The hotel room is simple, sufficiently sized, and was clean. The breakfast spread is not much, but enough to get us going in the morning.",5
beatrice390,ARROGANT FRONT DESK ATTITUDE!,"As an old and loyal costumer , I feel lots of changes with the services especially front desk team performance. Before pandemic, all front desk staffs fill with friendly and warm attitude toward guests , but unfortunately after 1 year closing all those front desk staffs are gone and replaced with arrogant and unfriendly staffs. My kid accidentally made a hot chocolate from coffee machine and one of front desk staff ( Mr. Wang Wei ) told me with angry tone and face ‚Äú Could you tell your son that you have to pay first before he could make that hot chocolate ?‚Äù And could you ask your kid to move away from that coffee machine before you make payment ?‚Äù üôÑ Well, I think next time hotel should put price list beside that coffee machine so guests will understand. And, FIY if I",1

richard o,"Poor,poor,poor","Early July we‚Äôve stayed at this hotel on level 9, the room was impressive as the housekeeper was such a nice lady who really cleaned our room thoroughly, Back to Sg a month later and assigned to level 10th‚Äôs room was such a hell, the room‚Äôs carpet was so smelly and all the amenities were dated, including the pillows which were heavy used and smelly and worn towels.",1
Connor P,Sustainable and Stylish with great Service!,"Shockingly overpriced budget university lodging standard. No pool, limited gym without aircon. Rooms small but clean. Breakfast is poor quality food. The only 1 star positive is that the location is good. No rewards points for company 3rd party bookings. Very poor experience for a 28 night stay.",5
Adhika Hardhanu,My first great experience stayed at here,The Holiday Inn Express Orchard Gateway is a great place to stay in a prime location. I chose this hotel because of their sustainability efforts and free breakfast! Would highly recommend this to friends and other business travelers! The breakfast is buffet style (incredibly good - kudos to the chef!) and with my status at IHG I received a bonus welcome drink!,5
Rafiq Irfan,Good location and helpful staff,"The frontdesk Chester, Mika and also the manager Ms. Su so helpful The room is very good for me The meals so tasty I will come back in Singapore soon with my family and I will stay in Holiday Inn Express again I give 5 stars for the services overall.",4
fmoulsen,Thank you IHG EXPRESS Orchard,"Very convenient location where you can find food and cinema nearby. Also not too far from other hotspot locations in Singapore. Staff very helpful when you need some assistance. I have also accidentally left a valuable item upon checkout and the staff Mr Chester is very helpful in assisting me. However, I wish the breakfast can be served slightly earlier as the time I had to leave for work and the breakfast is at the same time.",5
Fau,"Inferior Product, Low Value for Money Hotel",I enjoyed my 10days stay at this hotel. Had small bumps on payment issue and the front desk staffs are really helpful and being so patience keeping up with me and my issues. 10/10 to the team esp. NAQIAH. Breakfast was good too. Chef Ram did well serving us a very good breakfast with various options to choose for.,1
Itravel0ne,Convenient and good stay,"The small sister from Holiday Inn did not look like the big sister at all. Quite disappointed to be honest. I dont even know why they got the SG Clean label whereas it was totally different than what i found. First impression was the room was dirty, the main switch light had blood splattered, got hair stuck in between towels, lipstick mark on the coffee mug, stain marks on the bed sheet, room was heavy with dust, and worst of all? Promise not kept. I rang the hotel before booking if the hotel is willing to put plywood board underneath the mattress (normally to give more support), the receptionist said YES. i put this condition in writing too at the time of booking, and when i checked in at the hotel, receptionist also said YES. I kept asking for it, after a week of keep",4
Mystery,Need to improve,,5
Elizabeth L,First hotel I have stayed at that I had to make my own bed,"The location is great and centrally located. Easy access to the malls and eateries along Orchard road. Room is well design as typical of the HIE. Staff are friendly and can‚Äôt fault any of the service except that the phone and safebox in the room was not working when we checked in. But it was fixed after it was reported. Breakfast is good and sufficient. Timing of breakfast is crucial as you may not find seats at certain hours. Overall, it was a great stay.",1
alexserapio,Hospitable Staff,"Stay there for staycation 3 day 2 nights. The check in was fast however the front desk never brief us in detail about the facilities. 1 of the day our room was not clean,when we call the frontdesk they say is 3 day once. I paid 1 night $200+ and the hotel clean every 3 day.The manangement need to change this procedure.",3
Sundari,Duty Manager Naqiah& Nabila staff is friendly and helpful.,Apparently due to covid housekeeping now only takes care of your room once every 3 days. We were told that we needed to ring reception to get on the housekeeping list so don't bother to hang the housekeeping required on the door. Very disappointing when you are an elderly couple No complaints about staff. Very helpful Breakfast was good but we will not be returning,1
Entrepreneur,"Brilliant hotel, great people and second home!",Very accommodating front desk staff-Mika and Gerald. Warm welcome from Sales-Ms. Su Han and Karen. Sumptuous Asian breakfast from Chef Ram and mainstay Wang. Very clean room and prompt service form housekeeping staff Kelly. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives.,5

Anras Tendean,Great Service & enjoyed my stay,"If there is one hotel which one can come close to calling home its HolidayInn Express Orchard Road ,SG! The leadership of the manager in charge SuHan is commendable and the team to back the execution. When it comes to guests there is nothing that cannot be solved, whether food, or a cab or just help in moving around. The location is simply the icing on the cake. Clean, Comfortable and Value for the experience!",4
BillyBrocha,Great service by Housekeeper Kelly,"Location of this hotel is perfect if you love to shop whether high end or not. Situated near Orchard road, walking distance to restaurants, shops, hospital, convenient stores. Staff are very accommodating to the extend that they offer free bottled water to guests. Free breakfast from 6:30-10:30am and you can have it take away if you wish. Unfortunately, there is no swimming pool, no bath tub in case that‚Äôs your requirement. I was not able to check if there is a fitness room. Over all, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and all staff show their smile while entertaining us. We will definitely patronize this hotel again. Thank you so much Holiday Inn Express!",5

TC Yin,Excellent staff service,"I stayed at this hotel with family with my IHG points redemption. We chose this hotel due to its location, as it is superbly located near Somerset MRT station and Singapore's finest shopping malls. Upon check-in, it was clear that service is absolutely spot on - professional, efficient and courteous. Adding another feather to this hotel's bow is the size of its rooms. The connecting rooms that we got was one of the biggest rooms I have seen for a HIE (bigger than some HIs in Europe!). The clean and ample space came with courteous room service staff. Another pleasant surprise was that the breakfast menu varies throughout the week with local specialties. The staff managed to find seats for us even during its peak hours. Overall, this hotel is a credit to the IHG brand",5

CCHSingapore,IHG Never Disappoints,"I highly commend on the great team work during the morning rush hour,ensuring hotel patrons get their seats, clearing the tables, serving them. Waitress Wang is so pleasant. Everyone served wtih a smile. I love the customer service of the staff. The hotel itself isn't so great but the service more than compensates for the buidling. As they say, people make the difference. And it was wonderful to see interacial and intercultural harmony within the staff. I saw Chinese, Malay, Burmese and Indian staff working well. Truly unity in diversity.",3
Been Around,Amazing Stay with Standout Team Members,"Stayed 1 month there. Served 2x SHN-stays (7 days qurantine, too) whilst my stay. Absolutely friendly, helpflu and very supportive staff. Whenwver there was need for assistance or requests, they managed to support absolutely well. Rooms are cosy and very comfortable as well as very clean. Location is just perfect next to Orchard road. Will definitely choose this hotel for any friends visiting me in SG.",1
Michaelsim S,Excellent Hotel with good location on Orchard Road.,"To be honest, I have never taken notice of this hotel till I stayed here. Located off the main road, I am quite thankful it is away from the hustle and bustle. In fact, it is an oasis of peace and quiet. Checking in was easy and efficient, and the process was completed in less than 10 minutes. I had asked weeks before my arrival if my bicycle can be placed in the storage room, and the hotel nicely obliged. Nurul, at the front desk, made me feel welcomed quite immediately. I was told that to beat the crowd, having breakfast before 8am would be best, and that was what I did the morning after. I was very happy with my assigned room. It had all the guestroom and bathroom amenities a guest would possibly need. Scan a QR code in the room and information ranging from food menu",5
Moe Thu Aung,The great hotel.,I would like to give the highest praise to the team here who went out of their way to address my needs during my stay. I would like to particularly highlight the efforts of Mr. Jan Faizal Abu Bakar who went above and beyond to make me feel like a valued guest and customer. In the last nine months I have stayed at ten different IHG properties. This experience is one that will standout. I shall be back!,5
alanthegreat,Spacious for a Holiday Inn,"I like the location because of luxury shopping malls are surrounding.

Sirjit,"Great service, Comfortable rooms","The room is pretty spacious compared to other Holiday Inns I stayed. Simple but adequate. Room is well taken care of. Bed is definitely comfortable. I dislike the bathroom. The door either close for the shower area or the entire bathroom. If u close for the shower area, it means the toilet bowl area is exposed. If u close the entire bathroom, u gonna wet the entire toilet too. It just doesn't make sense. Also, the room is a bit too close to the office building opposite. I can see workers hustling at their desk. I'm not sure if I am motivating them or demoralising them by having a vacation on a weekday!",1
Sun,Quarantine Stay,"I am on doubt about the good comments from Trips apps. Below are experinces which i met on first and second day of quarantine. Days 1: Due quarantine 10days, we are arranged to holiday inn for SHN. On first day of check-in, I met a male chinese security staff here who spoke to me rudely and order me not to sit on the chair same row with my spouse (even with 1 m apart). Out of this, when I enquire on SHN information regarding optional dedicated facilities matter but he replied with he dont know what is that rudely which has made us feel uncomfortable. He even approached me for asking why i looked at him. Really like a gangster. Day2: call to receptionist to ask for more mineral water but she is telling me that singapore water is clean and mineral water is second option",4
Kayleigh,Great service!,"Was on QO for 7 nights but the staff (reception, security, housekeeping, F&B etc) provided such great service and were so accommodating to my needs. Really appreciate that they went out of their way to ensure my stay was as comfortable as it could be. The rooms are comfortable and everything was in working order. The meals were just fantastic- the staff allowed me to chose my cuisine everyday (just needed to give 24 hours notice) Thank you very much for making my stay so wonderful.",5
John Cover,Quarantine,"When we received the quarantine order, we were worried about which facility we would be staying in, especially regarding the cleanliness and food provided. It was a huge relief stepping into a clean, big and comfortable room which would be our home for the next 10 days. The room looked very new and was equipped with all necessary amenities and most importantly, fast Wi-Fi. Fortunately, our room was brightly lit so the sun could shine in at times. We were impressed with how tasty the meals were. We could see the effort put into preparing the meals and encouragement notes. Kudos to the chefs and staff! The hotel team was polite and friendly. They were very responsive, attending to our requests promptly and patiently. Thanks for making our quarantine stay a pleasant one.",1
AUNG,Quarantine,"The rooms are simply decorated but everything that i need is provided and it‚Äôs also very comfortable to stay in.

Muhammad Hamzah,Quarantine,"I was so frustrated receiving a quarantine order considering that it was the month-end, and I was buried up to my neck with lots of work to do. Adding the anxiety because I was a close contact was not helping. However, I was relieved as soon as I stepped out of the van and saw where I would be staying. I'm an IHG Rewards Club member so I knew service would be top-notch. The entire process was so efficient, thanks to the SG govt and all the staff throughout. Truthfully, I wasn't disappointed, room is impeccably clean. Could hoped for a better view though, but who would complain for a free ""staycation"". The staff are so patient handling my food requests and bringing deliveries promptly. The room is sound proof, water pressure is good, fast wifi, cable provided, great food.",4
Yu Ri,Quarantine Order,"Being in quarantine order is not a good moment when you have to stay whole day & night in the room . However , staying in Holiday Inn Express make you feel like home, comfy and cozy . The internet connection was fast and reliable . Able to do work and engage in TEAMS meeting without interruption.

Tourist667530,Great For Business and Shopaholic Travellers!,"Was assigned to serve my quarantine here for 14 days. Small but comfortable room. There are set meal times and the main let down was the consistently late delivery of the meals, at times up to 45 mins - 2, sometimes 3 out the 3 meals each day for the past 6 days so far have been late. Called the reception each time it was late and the replies were the same - it's on the way, coming up soon, sorry - will inform the manager etc. Can accept the occasional delay but every day for 6 days? Wonder if that will be the case for the remaining 8 days staying here. Being quarantined is already tough and to have this happening made it worse. Hope that the management can address this soon.",3
Mellieboo,LOVED every min of our stay. Will definitely come back,"Well, it's half a block off Orchard Road, but still excellent in every respect. We spent nearly a week there, during the Lunar New Year, using it as the base for our exploration of Singapore. Nice, large room, great breakfast, helpful and friendly staff, on-site DIY laundry...and an unbeatable location.",1
garygn,Terrific Hotel for it's price range and wonderful location,"Great location, few steps to Orchard Road where all the well known Shopping are around, especially Apple Store just right in front.

KKb,Quiet nest behind the busy Orchard Road,"Clean, efficient, convenient and in such a good location. I've stayed in many Holiday Inns around the world and this tops my list. Very clean and nice rooms that are spacious and with good air-conditioning for hot Singapore. We did not want to leave. Conveniently located in Orchard room and within walking distance to all malls, nothing to complain about. When we had forgotten to remove the do not disturb sign to our room in the day, they manage to turn the room around when we went out to dinner. Superb service! Having laundry machine within the hotel is so convenient too. I have already recommended this hotel and will be back in Oct for my next stay! The only let down were two things; 1) i couldn't get my IHG points because the hotel was not booked through IHG directly, which",5
Singgih,Nice Hotel in a good location,"This hotel is GREAT. Staff were so nice and helpful. Location is just GREAT. Convenient to so many stores, restaurants, metro system.

Holiday inn express successfully maintain the level of services, the cleanliness, comfort. Salute with the non pork breakfast. Whatever your request even above 9pm they manage to serve promptly.",5
MrtnVgt,Best of it‚Äôs kind,"Stayed five nights in late January at this hotel. The reason for choosing this hotel for my short break is the ideal location, close to quite a number of shopping malls and within walking distance to Somerset and Orchard MRT Stations. Check in was swift, the room, while small is adequate. The bathroom set up is quite unusual in that the bathroom glass door serves as a shower stall door and the main privacy door. The hotel has no inhouse restaurant or laundry service. The coin operated washing machines on the fourth floor is provided for guest use. The Great Room next to the Check In reception only provides a simple breakfast in the morning. In summary, this is a fuss free hotel where everything is self service and nothing more. However due to its strategic location, I would",1
Max,Great stay with family,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the second week of January this year, as a family of 4 in 2 rooms. Hotel was very nice, nothing really to fault it. Staff were very nice and friendly, Housekeeping were very efficient in their job, lovely little buffet breakfast included. Rooms were a good size too and very nifty bathrooms with a most unusual shower! Step outside and you are facing the side of the Paragon Centre, which is just so central in Orchard Road. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again.",4
Jabir Vakil,Value for money,"Probably the best hotel in this category I have ever staid at. That‚Äôs probably why it is so popular. It was busy at breakfast but the staff managed it all well. Tip! They have a nice gym at the 4th flour that is not listed. I found it when looking for the vending machine for a beer, which it did not have, but that is really the only remark I can make.",5
Vicky A,Ideal place for Business Travellers,"I recently had a long stay (7 nights) with this property. We are a family of 4 (2 children infant + 6 year old). The hotel is in a great location. We had many evenings and afternoons where we just walked out on to the heart of orchard road. It's close to the MRT as well. Now coming to the hotel itself. Very helpful staff - friendly too. We got an early check-in, no hassles. Breakfast was decent and the crew was always ready to help including tips and tricks of what to do in Singapore. The rooms are a bit tiny but the location and the hotel crew make it worthwhile.",1
Vira,Nice and Cosy,"Decent rooms, good amenities, amazing service, good spread of breakfast. Very much centrally located and close to almost all places in SG. Would definitely stay again if can book at similar rates, best amongst other hotels available at similar prices.",3
Jerry D,Short stay,"Located in the heart of Orchard Road, Holiday Inn Express Orchard is an ideal place for travellers. Walking distance to many outlets and malls and convenient to all type of visitors. Their Lobby Lounge is another place to have short business or friendly discussions in the evening coupled with fresh draught beer and other drinks",1
John,Continues to surpass expectations,The hotel staff was very accommodating right from the front desk to the housekeeper. The room was very nice and clean. The breakfast spread was excellent. I guess that is why there was not enough place to sit during breakfast. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Holiday Inn Express,5
newtravelleridn,hotel at the heart of singapore,Had an overnight stay. Went to a different Holiday Inn about a 10 min walk from this one. Room was small but clean. Bed was ok and shower hot. Only 2 creamers provided for 4 coffee packs. Very close to the Orchard MRT Station.,5
Charles Penafort,Holiday Inn Express Orchard Road - Experience 7 Star Service,"Such a great hotel in the thick of Orchard. Customer service at this hotel is second to none.

Michelle A,Perfect for all travellers,"Offering a 7 Star Service at an extremely reasonable price. That's the experience that Ms Ng Su Han and her team will accord you when if you select to stay at the Holiday Inn Express just off Orchard Road. The location is extremely conveninent being on Orchard Road and just across the road from Paragon...one of the best upmarket shopping malls in Singapore....if not the best. And the hotel itself has a fresh neat design which by design facilitates simplicity and efficiency. The staff are quick, friendly and courteous. In fact...it is impossible to fault them on any category ! Highly recommended if you prefer to stay right smack where the action is in Spore...at the most reasonable price...where no one can beat you on value for money !",1
Rachel_Intl_Foodie,Needs better insulation,"We stayed here for one night in December 2019. We took a taxi from the airport, which cost 22 Singapore dollars, while the return taxi cost 19 Singapore dollars. The hotel is extremely well located about 15 seconds' walk from all the shops and restaurants on Orchard Road. Despite that, the hotel was very quiet. The service at the check-in reception was very friendly. Also when we were having breakfast one of the chefs passed by and asked if everything was ok, where we were from etc, and wished us a good day. The breakfast buffet was very good with an adequate selection of Asian and non-Asian dishes. The room was fairly large with all the amenities and the wifi worked well. The only area where this hotel needs improvement is the fact that the bathroom is enclosed in",4
garutma,Enjoyable Stay,"I stay at Holiday Inn Express Orchard every year with large groups of students and parents. The hotel staff are amazing and accommodate all our needs, including early breakfasts and speedy check in. The location is perfect - malls with great food and shopping right outside the hotel. Hotel will quickly get you a taxi or help you get to wherever you need to go. Couldn't ask for better service. Would recommend this to anyone travelling to Singapore and you want to be right in the heart of great shopping.",5
Wandering_Gal2013,Lovely Stay 2nd Time Around,"The hotel is well located for a shopping trip to Singapore, as it is just off of Orchard Road, where most of the shopping malls are located. It is clean, the staff are friendly, and the price isn't terrible, though we thought it was overpriced for what we got. We had two issues that made the hotel just average for us though. The first is the size of the bed. If it was a queen bed, as advertised, it is the smallest queen I've ever seen. My husband is quite tall (1 meter 88 or 6 foot 3 inches) and he barely fit length-wise and between his shoulders and my belly (7 months pregnant), we just fit width wise. We have a queen sized bed at home and we fit in it much better than we did this bed. The second and much more irritating feature of the room was the poor insulation",1

Surprised that they knew it's our 2nd time around coming back to stay with them. We had some welcome refreshment drinks and the rooms were up to standard of cleanliness.

Juzmin,Splendid hotel in orchard rd,"I have been very impressed with the hotel where our family stayed last week. We go almost every year to Singapore and it is one of the best located hotel on Orchard road. It is right in the centre of Orchard road and very convenient for shopping. We used to stay in hotels further up Orchard road but they were quite far at the end of the road. The room was a bit small but very nice and clean. There is a complimentary breakfast and it gives a good variety of food. The attendants at breakfast are also very efficient and friendly. The staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. We booked the room for 8 nights well in advance and asked for an early check in whuch was not guaranteed and we were delighted to get the room at 9 am. That was fantastic after the long flight hours.",5
Heren SG,Good hotel next to shopping areas,Stayed here again for a few days last week and everything was as good as I expected from my previous stay here. Nice to know that the good standards are being maintained. Orchard Road is lit for the year-end holiday season and it's only a 30-second walk from the hotel to admire the bright lights.,4

Chee Lim W,Centrally located and value for money,"We stayed here for a couple of days during a short visit. This is not the best place for a quiet and relaxed holiday, as it was bustling with families on holiday and young visiting business people. But it was good value for money, with functional guest rooms, a decent breakfast spread and great location. Service was friendly, from check-in to check-out. The hotel has very convenient access to some of the best malls around Orchard Road, i.e. Paragon, Mandarin Gallery, Takashimaya, Wisma Atria and Ion, and even Wheelock Place with a hidden gem of a restaurant which we stumbled upon during our stay (see separate review on Pistachio Mediterranean Grill!).

Angelo,Excellent location,"It is always our go-to hotel whenever we visit Singapore. Given that it is located right in Orchard, the price of the rooms are reasonable. It averages at SGD230 per room per night (including tax). The room comes with complimentary breakfast and complimentary drinks as well. Breakfast has a good spread too and it is open until 11am! So great for those who wake up late. The toilet is a little small and it shares door with the shower. Thats the only downside. Otherwise, the room size is good!",1
jaimepage77,Great Hotel Great Location,"We stayed at this establishment from 01 November to 04 November 2019. We were given a room on 15th floor, so it was the second highest floor for this hotel. From the moment we checked in, the service has been great. Free bottle of water was provided by the room service. Also, when the chambermaid, Kelly, cleaned the room, it was done very efficiently. It was not our first time we stayed at this hotel, and it never fails to please us. No need to mention about the location as it's only, literally, a stone throw away from Orchard Road. Breakfast is included in the rate, and it can get very busy past 7:30am, but the hotel replenish the food fairly quickly.

We stayed on the 16th floor , very quiet and clean , if there is only a drawback , then it should it be the lobby and reception area , it can be a bit noisy and cramp during certain hours of day ( check in and check out time ) , otherwise I would be coming back to stay at this hotel",1
Flofif,"Excellent, the most recommended hotel in spore","I would recommend this hotel and look forward to going back for a second bite. Location was brill, rooms were lovely, the staff were awesome, the breakfast was perfect, and it was reasonably priced. Getting around was a breeze, with fairly easy access to Somerset MRT, though it is a bit of a rabbit hole in finding your way in and out! Shopaholics, shopping is literally on your doorstep. Have fun!",5
Ninie,Good location & great service,"Enjoyed my stay here very much. Nice, comfortable rooms. Handy to many dinning places and 2 MRT stations.

Located in the heart of the famous orchard boulevard just behind the apple store building. The room was clean, the housekeeping clean the room everyday clearly. The front desk staff was friendly & helpfull. The bed was comfy with firm & soft pillows. The safe deposit box & refrigerator was also provided. For moslem, this hotel is very moslem-tourist-friendly. The hotel provide us with halal certified food in breakfast buffet. There is also qibla sign in the room. The toilet equipped with bidet shower. Just in front of the hotel is Al Falah mosque. I do recommend this hotel to stay in singapore.",4
Daniele A,nothing special,Location is great walking distant to shopping centers. Very impress with maid service on the first day. She really help me tidy up my messy stuff because I had to hurry for work. So once back to the room it is ready for me rest.

shanelle182,World class service only Singapore can deliver,"We are staying here for 6 nights for the Singapore GP. We normally stay at much more luxurious hotels, so while this is not a 5 star hotel by any means it great for a number of reasons: 1. Amazing location, right behind Apple store (50m walk from Orchard rd). Also only a short 5 minute walk to Somerset train station. Also there's a great supermarket bottom level at Paragon shopping centre which is only 200m away if you want food, drinks, etc. 2. Beds are very comfortable (queen size) 3. Rooms are quiet (we stayed on level 6 and had no noise) 4. Breakfast was good. Not huge by any means but a good variety to choose from. 5. Price was fantastic especially for location and during GP Note this hotel doesn't have a pool if you are after a hotel with one. 110% would stay here",5

There is an unique phone on the desk ( not own by HI) but someone else. This is like a cell phone and you can take with you when you move around the city. You can make free local or international calls, but people can't call you back. Good when you don't have local sim card for local calls. A lot more features but I have no time to explore more.You can check out locals restaurants and store, but it stated that they collect all your datas.

Besides, we did not have to use a cab at all; Somerset is pretty centrally located. The room was very clean. I usually get a dust allergy on my travels abroad, but I did not sneeze here.

I do appreciate the hospitality of the staff. Didn't get her name, but she was very attentive and helpful when I asked for MRT going to Marina Bay Sand Theatre.

I just had issues with the bed honestly and we couldn't rest well after being so exhausted.",5
Selwyna V,Home away from home,"This is a great location if you are looking for something close to shopping centers and restaurants. It is smack down in the middle of Orchard road where all the prime shops are located. A 10 min walk away from the train station so not so bad. Rooms are clean, comfortable bed, and very sustainable hotel if I may add. Easy to get a taxi and staff is very accommodating. I did not give it a 5 star just because the options for food are not that many and area of the restaurant is not that big. Still, a great restaurant for anyone travelling on business and needs to be in the city area.",5
kokboon04,Good location,Stayed here again earlier this week and it was exactly how I remembered my previous stay - great !!

dito99,Just Accross Al Falah mosque,"In comparison to Holiday Inn City Centre i much prefer the City Centre coz the rooms are larger, wide array of choices at buffet breakfast, toiletries is complete. But as to the staff, i think its standard in every Holiday Inn, that everyone is so accomodating with your every request, everyone is kind and always serve you with a smile. The location is a dream, only a minute or 2 and you are at Orchard Road. Rooms are spic and span, they have 4 pillows for twin sharing one sft and one firm and get this...they provide you with your own cellphone! You can use it anyway you want, call local and international, google or socmed to your hearts content!! This hotel has an answer to all your needs. I highly recommend all Holiday Inn hotels in Singapore, double thumbs upüëçüëç",5

What i like the most of its spacious and its quietness. The king size bed was incredibly soft (depends on everybody‚Äôs preferance) and the extra bed i got was comfortable although it felt quite hard due to its function a sofa bed turned to a bed. The hotel provided us with breakfast and it gave us plenty of choices with fresh bread, milk, juice, fruits, various cereals. The staff is so friendly giving us a lovely stay. The only minus i can give was the signage of the hotel, so if you would like to get there, it is hard to look for it if you do not know the surroundings.

The staff at the reception who checked us in was very helpful and provided us early check in at 10.30 am. The cleaning ladies at the breakfast as well as rooms along with the kitchen staff were all very pleasant and had a smile on whenever they greeted. For a budget hotel, even though the breakfast selection was limited, it was of good taste and well balanced. They provided coffee cups along with paper bags for those who wished to carry their breakfast elsewhere. The only concern I had was the limited facilities provided in the room.

I have made an erroneous bookings 2 times, first one booked the Holiday Inn City Center instead, second one was double booking due to miscommunication, they helped fix it, went against the fine print and helped us. I know many other hotels are too greedy to break the rules and fine print. Secondly, this hotel provide breakfast, the most important meal of the day. It's not a fancy breakfast, but it's free and included when you stay there. Third, 2 Large beds. They don't use single beds, the use 2 large beds.

Shoutout to the reservations team leader, Mr. Elvis Ang for going out of his way in making sure our family of 5 got a connecting room. Kudos to you, Sir! You definitely made our stay worthwhile. 1. The place was very clean and well maintained. The lobby was a bit small but spacious. The size of the dining room is okay for a 3/4 star hotel, and they keep the area so clean especially when its breakfast time which was a shock to me. We usually sit and have our breakfast outside (they have dining tables and chairs outside too!) and was surprised that there are staff who made sure the tables were clean even outside. The size of the rooms were okay, and the beds were so",1
Kristen George,"Perfect location, Pleasant stay",The only specialty of this hotel is it is located on Orchard Road. The famous Takashimaya is very close to this hotel. As my first preference was to stay close to Orchard Road so I booked it. The taxi booking service from this hotel is very nice and generally you get it very easily due to its advantageous location. The Breakfast and the On the go breakfast option at the hotel is good here. Since it is very close to the Orchard Road so you can easily walk and hang out. You will not have views from the room all the high rises are beside the hotel. It is good if you don't have much to do except sleeping in the room. For working days this hotel should be fine.,4
Tamtim,Asia visit,The hotel is located in the heart of Singapore. The convenience of being on the orchard road was the first criteria we choose this hotel and we are so glad it was equally comfortable. The hotel staff was very helpful and always greeted with real smile on their faces. The rooms were reasonably priced and also offered delicious complimentary breakfast. The breakfast spread was very good and the restaurant guys were more than happy to customise the food as per our requirements. Ram and the entire team took special care of us at the restaurant and the front office made sure we are at comfort during our stay. Keep up the good work team!!!!,5
Derek Lee,A better Holiday Inn Express,"Hotel is located in the shopping hub, the hop on bus stops around the corner. The city shuttle stops at the hotel so very convenient to book from Changi at $9 per person. The hotel itself is clean, modern, good breakfast, good coffee. There is a mini fridge and safe in the room as well as a Handy phone with unlimited internet and calls which we used and found extremely helpful as we could take it with us. The staff are friendly, professional and very helpful. My only regret is that we didn't stay in Singapore longer. I would definitely stay at this hotel if I ever visit again and would highly recommend it to others.",1

The room we had doesn't have a mini fridge but there are some convenience stores around the block were you can grab some midnight snacks. Singapore is safe to walk around even in the wee hours of the night. The hotel also have lots of malls and shopping centers around the vicinity from high end shopping to budget, last minute buys. The hotel staff are very courteous, friendly and helpful. Their dining area are spacious enough with a widescreen TV and books for the book loving guest who would love to read",4
Florence C,Convenient and Baby friendly,"I've also thought Holiday Inn Express properties are clean quite good choices for travels, because they are always 1) clean 2) reasonably priced 3) free breakfast. The combination of all 3 makes its hard to ignore if the location is good. You basically know what you are getting when you book a HIE - no surprises. Location - I think HIE Orchard hits the spot in all the right places - the location is unbeatable for shopaholics being right in the middle of the Orchard action. The only flaw is that it doesn't have sheltered access to shopping which can be a bummer when it pours. But otherwise for what it's worth, it is pretty much value for money. Price - I lucked out winning the stay but the last I checked, rates hovered aroud $200++ a night for my stay dates. Check In - Arrived",5

Check in was quick, the staff was polite and helpful, the breakfast (which is included in the price of the room) offered many tasteful choices and, to our surprise, the chef would always be there asking the customers if there is something more that he could do for them, which added a very pleasant note to the overall experience.

bobseger,Hospitality,"These last 2-3 years, every-time I visited Singapore alone mostly for work, I opted to stay at Holiday Inn Express at Orchard Road. The main reason was its location and secondly was due to the decent price. Location wise it is in the middle of the busiest part of the long Orchard Road. If one likes to shop, then going back to the hotel to put the goods is really convenient. From the name, the accommodation is obviously a no-frill hotel, but bedding & amenities are as good as most five stars hotel. The room size is decent especially that I am always alone. Breakfast choice of menu is very good, although for a cappuccino lover - the push button maker is not great.",3
Lakshitha A,Fantastic hotel,"Have a strategic location around Orchard. The room is clean and nice. And they have a free handphone that can used by guest, as long as traveling in town.

This is so much useful. I can take this 'handy' everywhere i go without fear of getting lost in Singapore. nice. very recommendedüëç,5
CK_Den,Cosy and convenient hotel at Orchard Road Singapore,"This hotel ticks all the boxes of great location, bed comfort, cleanliness, good service, good breakfast etc. It is a convenient spot for business trips and very reasonably priced for family. the proximity to the heart of Orchard Road and the classy part is a bonus for most shoppers, or parents with kids in tow. It is the best value hotel in the Orchard Road vicinity. Note that this is a hotel without a pool so it is not for those dreaming of relaxing by the pool with a book and cocktail all day. Pay double for another hotel round the corner to fulfil your poolside wishes.",1
Crisma M,Deliciously wonderful stay!,"Firstly, it's located conveniently along Orchard road so all the famous shops and restaurants are just a stone's throw away. The room is big enough for two to three persons on a double bed room and is really clean! Oh, and it's a definite plus that the towels are soft. The almost transparent walls of the shower may be awkward to some people but once the mist comes in, it's all good. The food choices for breakfast may not be much but was really good. The coffee is also good so it's still a good breakfast experience. All in all, I had a great stay. Will definitely recommend this place.",4
asheesha317,Excellent service,"My favorite hotel in Singapore due to its location, quietness and convenience. Location: Very central location in Singapore City. Its along the famous Orchard Road right opposite the Mandarin Hotel and Gallery, Ngee Ann City. Besides Centrepoint, Paragon, and Lucky Plaza. Room: Very cosy, medium size, bed a bit too soft though. Clean. Restaurant: Breakfast lounge is small and packed but food is nice. Surprised to see chef in person greeting customers and asked about food and breakfast. Staff: Very courteous, polite and helpful. umbrella are available upon request. Transport: Close to Orchard MRT Station say 5 - 10 min walk through underpass under shopping centres from Tang to ION. Food: Lots of choice under all shopping malls. The famous Singapore Chicken Rice",5

It was a treat for my mom-in-law who had been a very industrious working old lady (turned 87 on Nov 7) and we wanted to offer her some enjoyable times by means of a travel treat. We stayed in 2 rooms. We chose the hotel because of the great reviews and its location being at the area where we can walk to a lot of convenient places of interest. When we arrived, we discovered that it was not only the great location that made it a little gem in Orchard Road, but also a lot of other outstanding features-- it smelled good and refreshing just to be at the lobby, though small, compared with other big hotels, it was warm and inviting with its nice and modern furniture and set-up.

Piya L,Great Location and Good Services,"It was our first trip abroad as a family to Singapore and my mom wanted to go shopping in Orchard Road so I decided to book a hotel nearby so it would just be short walk for her and the rest of us. A few days before our departure, there was a bit of a problem with our reservation so I panicked a little and took it as a sign that our Singapore trip would be one disaster after the other. I reached out to the hotel and, impressively enough, they were able to address the problem promptly. Turns out that there was a technical issue with their website, which somehow made duplicate reservations under my mom's IHG account. The staff were able to reassure me when I called them (and via email as well) that the 2 extra rooms will be canceled and the charges will be refunded. They were true",5

We chose to stay at the Holiday Inn Express because it was very central and easy to get to places. The staff were friendly. Our room was nice. It was clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and it was not a bad size. The bathroom was present in the room with semi-frosted glass and the bathroom door was the shower door too. A good way to save space but it did not feel quite private enough for my friend. The breakfast was included in our price and it was a buffet. It had a good selection of food and drinks to set you up for the day. Breakfast was very busy though, especially if you go at peak time. The location was great, just set back from Orchard Road.",4

It is in the centre of Orchard....You can go to Apple Store, Robinson, Paragon, and Takashimaya just a minute...Also you can go to mrt station either somerset or orchard within 10 minutes. For breakfast, this hotel has not provied a variety of food so it is good for the one who travels to Singapore for doing business or the one who do not expect in breakfast. The good thing is Holiday Inn Express have a service to take breakfast outside. The staffs are so friendly and can spend time to answer your questions.",5

This Holiday Inn Express is definitely one of the better ones. For one, the location is excellent, right next to the Orchard Road area and across the Paragon Mall. But otherwise, it retains a high quality overall - clean, stocked with amenities (toothpaste, ear swabs, etc.), decently quiet. The room itself is quite a good size - definitely bigger than, say the HIEs in Hong Kong. Only thing is the view, which just faces another hotel and is very drab. I didn't manage to get to the breakfast, so I cannot judge on that. But the service is fine (if not exceptional), and overall the price was reasonable for its location. Would definitely come",1

It actually worked to our advantage because two people could use the bathroom at the same time while one was in the shower. The room was kind of small but was very clean and neat. The location of this hotel is great. Easy access to shopping and the MRT. The only negative I have is the breakfast. If I did not book the room with the free breakfast, I would have given a higher rating. The food was not very good and the place was very crowded. The coffee from the machine was not good either.

It takes 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the train station which is not bad. The HANDY PHONE provided in the room is one of my favorite things that the hotel provide. I took the phone with me everywhere I go and did not bother to buy a local sim as the phone is equipped with 4G.

I've stayed at three different Holiday Inn Express hotels in Singapore, this one wasn't so clean as the others. The room had a foul smell that I couldn't manage. I called the front desk to unlock the window for air. I was required to sign a waiver, signing my life away in case I fell out the window. It made all the difference. And I lived to tell this review. The room is stuffy and small. Choosing a twin room is slightly larger than",5

They asked us to came back at 12pm for our room but nope, of course the room is not ready when we arrive. I dont mind that but the staffs dont even bother to inform us. Room is not really that spacey but it's quite okay. The toilet/bathroom design, I dont really get it but as long as it serves the purpose then I'm okay with it. Breakfast starts at 6.30 or something like that. Location not that far from bus station. There is a shopping complex in front the hotel.",1
ciobotariu a,Perfect location great stuff,"Knowing that it is rated as a 3.5 star property, my expectations were pretty much average in terms of the hotel facilities and its overall feel. However, as an IHG loyal customer, I am expecting a standard IHG level of service. I was surprised it exceeded my expectations on both. What I was particularly happy about are the following: 1. Free breakfast 2. Friendly and professional staff (which I expected) 3. Ideal location in Orchard road, right next to Paragon 4. Rooms are surprisingly big (which I didn't expect at all) 5. Fully equipped gym (also not expected) Overall, I would rate this property a 4 star. The property and the staff created a homely feeling for me. I can confidently say that I had a comfortable 4 nights stay at this hotel.",3

Little to see out of the room but that was the only negative point. Decent sized room and bathroom with a comfortable bed. Nice touches were the two bottles of water on arrival - replenished daily and the ""Handy phone"" - can be used in and out of the hotel. It can be used just like a normal mobile phone - for directions and surfing the net - as well as free worldwide calls! Breakfast also good - could be busy at times, but of you got a table there was a wide variety of hot and cold items. Will use the hotel again when we next visit Singapore.",1

A lot of choices nearby for food e.g. McDonalds and Burger King etc. For a quick stop over it is convenient and clean. Bedding and pillows available are above average. Which can be essential for a good nights rest. In my travels in UK, USA, Malaysia and Thailand, Holiday Inn has maintained their quality.

The rooms are surprisingly spacious and comfortable for a budget hotel, the gym is clean with well good equipment, the breakfast is adequate, and the hotel has a self serve laundry facility which is handy on long stays. The location is also a real highlight as you are in the heart of the action on orchard road.

The only bad thing that I have to experience every morning was the water pressure in the shower room. I need to rush for meetings every morning but the water pressure was just too low. I understand that they made it that way for environmental friendly reason, but still, I think they need to adjust it depending on each guest request.

woso,Great location & great value & super friendly staff,"In general, no complaints or ‚Äúmust mention‚Äù compliments. The staff was very friendly, throughout the hotel. That is always a plus. It is located right off of Orchard in the heavy shopping district, but still convenient for business. Breakfast is crowded. An above average HIE overall.",3
rupamchaudhury,Excellent stay..,"Part of choosing an executive room gets you entry into the executive lounge which serves brekky through to evening drinks and snacks as part of your room fee. We found it amazing - good selections for brekky, and enough selection to be able to eat our main meal at night, before hitting the tourist night attractions. Much less expensive than eating out, with wine available! The hotel staff were exceptional - courteous, friendly and bent over backwards to make our stay perfect - a definite return visit. We used the pool - clean and well looked after. The spa needs a bit of maintenance! Poolside eating is a bit pricy, and you need to ring for service, it is not staffed for food and drinks. Our room was well maintained, clean and spacious, with normal amenities.",1
Angelo N,Essential and near to orchard road,"We recently stayed 4 nights at this hotel. First of all it was easy to reach by metro, took us around 40 minutes from the airport, once arrived we were warmly welcomed at the reception. We stayed at the upper floor and the room was spacious, tidy and super quite. It didn't have a nice view, this didn't bother us, since we were mainly sightseeing during the day. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast, which had everything we needed. The personal was super friendly and even organized a flavored yogurt which was missing one morning for the next breakfast. We have stayed at several Holiday Expresses around the world, but this one was the best.",5

Maya P,Strategically Located at Orchard Shopping Paradise,"If you want to go Singapore for shopping, it's one of the best choices. Just round the corner of the hotel is the main street of Orchard with all the shopping malls and brand name. Room size is reasonable and bed is comfortable. Breakfast provides a fair range of food, but quite the same items for the 4 days I stayed. Suggest take MRT or bus, not taxi as there is surcharge for central area especially during peak hours.",4
the_larb,Great location and has everything you need,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights for the Singapore Grand Prix. The hotel has an excellent location and a very courteous staff. Orchard Street is just a walking distance from the hotel. Though the hotel offers a fair selection of food, it is recommended to try the various dining options around the place. Would definitely revisit the hotel on our next visit to the country.",5
Eddie Arsyad,Convenient and nice hotel,"I find that this hotel's value is fantastic for its location and price. Strategically located right in the middle of Orchard, shopping malls are all within walking distance. Size of the room is small, but sufficient. Staff are friendly and helpful. Bathroom size is a bit too small, though. Breakfast variety is good enough, but rotation can be improved as I find myself getting bored of the same menu - since I stayed for more than 3 days.",1
645wanderer,Surprisingly of good value,This hotel has a great location being just off Orchard. The rooms are basic but great for the price. Unlike other Holiday Inn Expresses in Singapore the WiFi is super fast and there is even an iron in your room even though if you are above 5foot tall you feel like Guliver when pressing your shirts. Check in/out is also really quick. Would definitely stay here again.,3

Relentless,"Comfy, spacious, close to orchard","I stayed here a few years ago and I rated the hotel as 4 stars with nothing relevant to mention. Just returned from a second stay, glad to see the hotel is keeping up with its great standards. Breakfast was a bit ""as usual"", although much better than in another hotel in Singapore where my company has sent me recently. Fantastic bed, if ever a bit too small, good room facilities, all basic but all working seamlessly. This is basically what one needs for a good sleep, a good shower and all in a great location in the middle of Orchard road. Plus, it is what they call ""smart hotel"", which means there is not so much wastage as in other traditional hotels whilst not compromising the comfort. For those a bit concerned about the environment, it's good news and a good guarantee of",4
Brian9992013,Nice hotel and situated in the main shopping area,"EXCELLENT hotel a half block off of Orchard (which is nice). GREAT rooms in a GREAT location with access to EVERYTHING on Orchard Road. The breakfast is OUTSTANDING! The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars is because the fitness center is OUTSIDE. Yes, OUTSIDE... makes for some HOT and HUMID workouts. The equipment is great, and there are fans, towels, and cold water to keep you moving. The service here is EXCEPTIONAL. They have been TERRIFIC about arranging cab service, especially for our group of 6. And, the room cleaning has been prompt and extremely professional. If you are military, this hotel is an EXCEPTIONAL choice because it CONVENIENTLY located between the Changi Naval Base and the COMLOGWESTPAC HQ. I would rate this hotel a MUST TRY!",5
rias854,Nice hotel with good location too,"Booked thru online travel site. Provided with a twin bed plus a sofa bed. Spacious room. Walked in bathroom with closet with standard amenities. Clean. Wifi was fast. Breakfast was a bit packed as the dining space was small. Do come very very early. Close to a mosque so a fav among muslim travellers. Close to orchard, tucked away behind robinson at orchard. Close to mt elizabeth medical center also.",1
jcd_mnl,"Superb Location, Efficient Service, and Great Value","I have stayed in Holiday Inns worldwide and am a Priority Club member. I always find the standards consistent and I know what I'm getting. The Express chain is the budget model in the chain and you cannot expect the same facilities as a full service Hotel. As I very rarely use the gym, pool and a few other things I didn't miss them. Having said that I thought the rooms a good size, extremely clean, modern and had Safe etc and we all slept well. The breakfast was small but more than sufficient. The staff were very friendly, helpful and polite without exception. This is a new Hotel and obviously run by enthusiastic management and staff, keep up the good work you are all doing great. We only stayed two night but next time I visit Singapore I would be more than happy to stay here",4

The price is Good Too :) the rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfast is good, the atmosphere is very homey .. i liked. close to the shopping center, close to the MRT station, I think the hotel service here is not much different from other expensive hotels, I really like this hotel :)",5
CAMLap46,"Great value, great location","Centrally located so very close to Orchard Road's shopping centers, restaurants, and the MTR station so very convenient. The hotel itself is great! Staff are very helpful and friendly, the rooms are generally spacious, clean and comfortable. There's not much amenities but then again, it works within your budget. The only thing I would like to see improve is their breakfast buffet selection which is not great - you're better off checking out one of the many nearby coffee shops on Orchard Road. Other than that, always a reliable and comfortable stay at HIE on Orchard. I've stayed many times and each experience is consistently good.",1
Rizwan S,Everything within budget,Went for Christmas last year and this hotel contributed to one of our amazing holiday. From friendly smiling staffs and attentive managers it made us feel like we are home. Highly recommended! Our room was tidy and clean too.,3
shey_La,good location,This Holiday Inn Express is well located just off Orchard Road close to the many shopping centers in this location and the MTR.

Helpful staff.,1
busylifeontour,"Good location, reasonable rates but great staff service","Great location. Right opposite to the mosque Al Falah on Orchard Street and in between Paragon and Robinson's malls. Toilets come with hand shower and toilet rolls. Very useful for those who prefer to use water instead of paper towels or both. Room size and in room facilities are adequate. Liked the sofa chair in the room with foot rest. Good enough to fall asleep on it! I think this hotel comes with everything you will find in a luxury hotel but at a reasonable price. Has a handy phone, safe and alarm clock too. Although there is no exclusive restaurant of their own, the hotel serves breakfast every morning and you can choose to order food through the hotel from an Asian, Indian and a Mediterranean restaurant. Again, quite affordable! Overall, I'm happy and having stayed on the",5
ErnaD,A nice hotel in a good location,"the hotel is located right at the heart of orchard. the room is nice and clean. basic amenities are provided. breakfast buffet is just simple with limited choices but can fill your tummy, just be sure to be at the resto early. they dont have room service, so you have to literally get your orders at the lobby/front desk. just be sure to tell the taxi driver that your staying at holiday inn express orchard otherwise they will drop you off at holiday inn orchard.",5
JoseSenaCruz,Excellent ratio price/overall quality,"Right in the orchard road with reasonable rate include daily breakfast. I like express breakfast concept, quality not quantity. Positive; breakfast, bed and sleep quality and helpful staff. My friend forgot his mobile in taxi, the front desk staff named Chester gave us a hand to call and follow up with taxi company until driver came back. Highly appreciated. Negative comments; I stayed on 9 the floor with the painting smell along the corridor walking to the room. I found out that they did the painting somewhere with the wet paint signage. I always have a bad luck here in Singapore with holiday inn express. I changed to this orchard road and faced the same thing.",4
MikeJefferies,Good value hotel in a central location,"It was a new 4 year old building very closed to Orchard road. Good location, a simple, nice and efficient hotel. The bed and bath room were good. Breakfast was good. The staff also were nice. Only tissue was not in good quality.",5
Grand L,"Great location, comfortable, and good service even though the room is smallish",The hotel is very well located in the heart of Orchard street. The rooms are really good (taking into account that is a 3* hotel). It is really tidy and clean. Every single day day give bottles of water and you have the possibility of doing tea. The breakfast has a lot of diversity and the hotel staff is really kind.,1
Tony T,Ideal location for those who love to shop in orchard road.,"Stayed here two nights over a weekend. It's a short walk from a couple of metro stations (though Somerset involves crossing two busy roads), and is well positioned with plenty of food outlets and shops around it Breakfast was a bit basic, and on the first morning we had a bit of a struggle to get a table. It was adequate though, but mainly oriental rather than western. Check in was very efficient. Wifi was good, but you're limited to four devices. You can remove one to use another, but I didn't manage to do that.",4
happygmb,Great service and location,Walking distance to all amenities on Orchard Road. Breakfast was decent and included in the rate. Service was good. Room was smallish but comfortable and clean.

Highly recommended if you want to be close to Orchard!",5
Johan P,Very nice and friendly atmosphere in perfect location,"I think it was love at first stay the minute I step into the the hotel. As it was quite earlier than the usual check-in time, luck was just on our side, it was the quickest check-in experience ever! ""Express indeed!"" and we manage to get the room straight away. Staff were all oh so friendly, everyone of them, which makes the stay just really nice. I really can‚Äôt stress enough how everyone took pride in their respective role. If I were to pick the part that I didn't really like, is the size of the room.The room is a bit small, but it's OK. Not a big issue though. I've stayed at a slightly more expensive hotel in Singapore but even much smaller than this. What was also cool, is the hotel gave each guest a ‚Äúhandy‚Äù smart phone, which is really convenient as it saved us roaming",4
azahari,Great hotel!!,"If you value your time to enjoy the city centre and its shopping malls attractions, this hotel is for you, as for my family. The location is just so great with few steps to the Orchard road. The room is okay, means clean and spacey enough for Singapore standard. Just a less assortment of breakfast variety compare to its siblings (HI Orchard City Centre), and their croissant taste should improve. Nice service fr the staff, they are polite and helpful. It takes 20-30 minutes by taxi from Changi airport.",5

Location was close to all the high fashion brand shops, close to MRT so travel anywhere in city was also easy.",1
Aunkok,Superb !,"No need to say Holiday Inn met their standard as usual. Location is perfect for me since it's on orchard road and close to Paragon mall (2 mins walk) and 313 Sommerset (10 mins walk). Well, on orchard means everything for shopper already. My favourite Superdry is just across the hotel. That's perfect. Sommerset MRT is 10 mins walk, still convenient to walk from there to hotel. Hotel provides mobile device for you to use during your stay. I didn't try to call with it but use internet when I'm in hotel. It said you can use it all around singapore for both call and surfing internet. The hotel is 40 minutes away from airport by taxi that would cost around SGD 20. Airport to Sommerset by MRT cost you around SGD 2.5. On the other hand, lobby is quite tight. We didn't use hotel",3

Many options for restaurants too. I found hotel breakfast is excellent and very helpful if you are attending any business work in the morning. Reception staff is always ready to help. I think house keeping can be improved a little bit.,5

The Staff is excellent (Devi, Alvin, Elvis, JenNee and Donl on the front desk, the doorman Jason and Lisa on the breakfast staff). All the staff was pleasant and smiling ALWAYS. I feel like I have made friends for life. Rooms were kept very clean; the exercise room was kept tidy and had all the right equipment; the breakfast selections were always good (a nice variety daily); and the location just can't be beat.

The staff is nothing to write about. The room & specially the washroom is cramped for the price. Please note that am comping by global standards and Singapore generally is expensive.",4
CliAngela,Nice hotel and good location,This is the 2nd time I stayed here. Staffs are nice. Location is very convenient- right behind Orchard Road. You can travel here by MRT etc. Walking distant to Takashimaya & Paragon shopping mall (where you can get upmarket shopping). Both places have food court; you can try local foods & wide range of choices. As usual the room is not very spacious but better than the others few Holiday inn express here & the wifi is good. Only breakfast is really so so! One good thing for Holiday inn express here; they provide mobile phone for local call & internet. Very thoughtful.,5

The front desk staffs are the most wonderful people ever ! You won't see that in any other hotel. Most hotel staffs are nonchalant but this is totally different. The front desk staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, provide us with lots of useful tips and places to go.

Rainee_24,Wonderful location of hotel,"Good location but my family is not very lucky during this trip. Handy phone in the room is a great help for travelling in singapore. We stayed here last time and its wonderful but this time there is a bit of a problem with the water in our room (802 & 803). What really impressed us is the way the hotel dealt with it. It is the most professional manner we have ever experience and its way better than most 5 star hotels you can find. We made a call and the manager, Donald is up at our room in a few minutes. He even offered us another room just to shower in at the moment while they fix it but we didn't take it. We can see how concerned they are and that they are trying to fix it. Most impressive part is how seriously they take our complaint. He checked with us at least 5-6 times",5

Main drawback of this hotel was that they do not provide bell boy service and u need to carry your luggage to you're room.. Plus no room service too. If you want to have something in your room u need to carry your cutlery from their kitchen. Also For breakfast there were very little options for vegetarians...,5

The hotel is clean and rooms are standard holiday inn sizes with views of other buildings which is common for cities of this size. Apple enthusiast would love this hotel since its located behind the newly opened Singapore Apple Store. A hotel laundromat is a plus for those who travel light especially on business trips and the outdoor concept gym is different from other hotel gyms i've used previously. Since i stayed till the beginning of ramadhan, i was happily surprised to know that the hotel also provides sahur and its location across the Al Falaah mosque, devout muslims can easily perform daily as well as terawih prayers with ease.",1

I didn't expect too much, since it is a Holiday Inn Express, but it did surprise me with a few nice touches. Location: Can't be beat. It's right smack behind Singapore's first Apple Store on Orchard (pity it wasn't opened until the Saturday on the week that I left). Food: You don't even need to plan for your food as the myriad of shopping centres offers so many choices at their food courts and restaurants! Transport: Somerset station is less than 5 minute's walk away, and likewise is the nearby Orchard station as well. If you prefer a bus, there's on just 2 minutes away. Rooms: If you're a couple or even alone, the room size is adequate enough. Inside",3
Dan S,Good value for an Orchard Hotel,"The Holiday Inn Express was a pleasant surprise! What we liked: Clean, modern style bedrooms, large beds with comfy pillows. They provide you with a handyphone that you can use during your stay. Fantastic location! It takes less than a minute to walk from the hotel to Orchard Road. Breakfast buffet was a bit small but they had those that I liked - sausages, ham, bacon, eggs, pancakes and waffles, hashbrowns, cereals, bread, fruit. What we didn't like: I can't think of any. With the hotel's great location, nice rooms and service, and it's reasonable price, it's a steal! No wonder it's almost always fully booked!",1
TuanaUmit,Great Location,"Excellent customer service. Kudos to Jen Nee and Mary The hotel is located around 5 minutes from Somerset and Orchard MRT station, which makes it easy to travel.

The pillow is very comfortable the soft one I mean, I had one of the best sleeps ever. The hotel even have a 24 hour operated gym which I find very convenient for guest.

Secondly, my family who stayed in the other room asked for a spare quilt/blanket amd much to our disappointment it was not available and on top of that the air conditioning has some sort of auto reset and as such we are unable to change the temps to our specifications The in room menu..please don't be fooled..the hotel does not make it..they order it from outside which may take hours In their favour, we didn't know about",1

Breakfast (for vegetarians) could be improved upon with some hot and well-cooked dishes. The red light on the smoke detector in the room was an annoyance the first night...

Breakfast was great with a very large variety for every taste. There was some confusion with taxis as there is more than one Holiday Inn Express. But this location was great and within walking distance of shopping museums and restaurants. The free mobile phone was a plus too.",5
Krisandi S,Top quality hotel in the middle of Orchard rd,"I always stay here whilst in Singapore because of our addition to shopping in Orchard road. This is the best price for a really clean, no fuss room 1 minute to Singapore excellent train service and of course shops and places to eat. These guys have step up a notch. The free breakfast has improved significantly and free use of a mobile phone tops it. Hey I am here for shopping why waste your money on a hotel room that I will not use its facilities.",5
WelshBird07,"A great little hotel, ideally situated","The hotel is good. Have a great location. Its brand new. Surprised us with early check in. Ive been to Singapore so many times & early check in is a rarity. Yet despite all that, there some things that i believe it can be improve 1. The housekeeping cleaned the room daily but i guess not thoroughly vaccumed . 2. Breakfast quality need to be imptoved especially bread section. Overall breakfast is ok, but bread section isnt to great . Will definitely stay here again",4
Rasisri,I like this place,"This is the first time we stay at this hotel. It turns out to be a near-perfect find as the location is prime, almost in the middle of the orchard road. Between orchard and somerset MRT station with only 5 minutes walk to either one. They provide a good breakfast along with our reservation with limited choice but good enough to fill our belly before going out. Coffee quality is very good. We have a few trouble in maintaining our room temperature using the remote because the auto function didn't provide enough cool air after a few hours and we have to switch the fan back and forth. The design of the shower door is interesting because they only use one door to either close the bathroom or the shower area, so sometimes water can flow out. There are laundry machines that guests can",5
ClauClau82,Can't fault it,"Recently stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with friends. We arrived at the hotel late at night after a long flight via Kuala Lumpur, only to find we had been allocated 2 x Double rooms rather than the 2 x Twin Rooms as requested on my booking. The check in staff advised that there were no twins available but after showing them my booking they did manage to find a room. Unfortunately we had to wait until the following day to change the second room but this wasn't a major issue as our 4th party member was not joining until later that day. I would advise you check in with the hotel a few days in advance if you are making a specific request. I have to say that the staff were polite and helpful whenever we had a query. The other thing to bear in mind is that the hotel specifically",1
devadevi,Enjoyed our stay,"These days I stay in Holiday Inn whenever I go abroad on business or pleasure. Usually I travel to Singapore or Hong Kong and I normally book myself into either HIE Bideford Road in Singapore or HI Golden Mile in HK. The rooms are spick and span and very well maintained and the staff great.The breakfast provided in the Express Hotels, though not great in terms of variety and choice, is usually nutritious and enough to start the day.",4
Joseph O,Excellent hotel with fantastic location,"Great location. Great service. Great facilities. Comfy bed, delicious pillows, good wifi, strong toilet douche, complimentary water bottles, cookies on arrival, modern and clean, amazing travel buddy phone, efficient friendly help. Really great all around!",5
Karen,Excellent service,Stayed here for 3 nights and had booked 2 rooms. We got both rooms on 6th floor. We managed an early check in (one room) so pretty happy with that. Service was good and breakfast was delicious. They have a nice location and Orchard Road is at a walk able distance. Staff was helpful and nice. Only thing missing in the room was a tub in the bathroom. Will surely visit again!,1
bubu1979,Fine for short stays,"Read fantastic reviews of this hotel and decided to try it out. Well, it certainly lives up to the fantastic reviews. The service was excellent from the reception all the way to the housekeeping. We arrived early at around 11am and requested for early check-in and we had a room available within 15 minutes which was excellent. The reception area was bit small but since it was connected to the breakfast cafe area, there was enough space for us to sit around. The rooms were modern and comfortable. For those who love soft beds, well Holiday Inn Express Orchard is for you. The rooms were well equipped with LCD television, coffee making facilities, refrigerator, safe, centralized controlled air-conditioning, free WIFI throughout the hotel and there was even a ""travel buddy""",3
Pei S,Great hotel,"I was there for 3D2N stay. I booked via booking.com for a twin bedroom aa there was a promotion. However, i was upgraded to a queen bedroom and was introduced to the IHG membership application so i could check in straight away. Thanks to the staff (named Mika, sorry if i got it wrong) who helped me with the smooth check in. Location needless to say it was strategically located which was one of the reason I chose to stay here. Breakfast is okay. Taxis are available. The room itself is clean and comfortable. Recommended and Definitely will stay here again.",1
phoukhaophet,Good stay Singapore,This hotel was my first experience the express concept in IHG world. pros: basic & bare necessities are catered to. cleanliness & bed quality are great. have a small outlet where one can have a small bite or a drink. location (especially if your work involves nearby places or you're a party animal then many options in walkable distance of 5 to 15mins) cons: apart from the housekeeping its a self service hotel. so forget room service. no restaurant kitchen which automatically means no room service either. The small outlet (I mentioned in pros) has very limited options (I guess 6-8 food items only) and runs out them very easily and is not open 24hrs either. The express (almost no-service) concept makes them offer rooms at a few dollars less than that of a full service hotel in,5
babitingz,"Great location, decent rooms",1. Room was really new and clean. 2. Great location and friendly hotel staffs. 3. Bed was very comfortable. 4. We all loved complementary breakfast. We will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and my clients when they visit Singapore.,5

Frank L,Accommodating,"Location is perfect. Property is good, still new and room size is not too small. Worth paying. However, room is not that clean, maid not changing bedsheet and still a dust in some spot. At breakfast, food is not variety, and too many local items.",1
Reslimpan,Great hotel,"location is the best.... the hotel has HANDY mobile phone in every room, we can use it during our stay, browsing, local or international calling is free if the country code is on their list... Japan, US, Indonesia are among the list. Breakfast is good, I really love this hotel",4
Ton AJJ van Dijk,Good hotel and very conveniently located,"I booked three rooms but had to cancel one due to unforeseen circumstances. Due to my heavy travel, I was not able to handle the cancellation in time. The manager, Mr. Eidrus, was very helpful and gave me credit for my next stay. I am happy with the outcome as I travel to Singapore for business and pleasure quite frequently. I find this hotel to be convenient and of good value. Despite not having a restaurant, it is only a short walk to the vast choice of restaurants in Orchard Rd. Besides, there is a ""bar"" that does serve Bombay Sapphire gin.",5

SUSAN D,Good experience,"Had a brief stay, arrived late afternoon, checked out in the morning. Room was small but functional. It is a no frills offering however it works well. I did not have the free breakfast however when I checked out it was very busy. One thing i liked was a sign in the lift which advised the busy time periods for breakfast,this is a good way to manage guest expectations. Was on the top floor, my room had a partial view over the city. As per other reviews, the location is very good. Was easy to walk with luggage from the Somerset MRT station to the hotel. Overall, it is not pretending to be something it isn't, and delivers well",5
Andrew S,Best Budget hotel I've stayed in Singapore.,This hotel is located at strategic place near to Orchard Road. It's good deal at Expensive area. The staff at front desk was vert attentive and fast. All the staff were friendly. The room size is worth for the price that I have paid. The breakfast was good. They had a lot varieties and taste good. The Indian breakfast was a surprise for me. So overall satisfied with my stay in this Hotel.,4
Brendon C,Good Location,We stayed at this hotel on our outward and return journeys to Sydney. Our stays were both excellent all the staff were very friendly and we would love to stay there again. It is close to shops food and busses. After touring the island on the hop on and hop off busses we saw lots of places and we decided we were glad we had chosen this hotel.,5
Mel P,Very comfy stay & perfect location,The room were smart and for a budget hotel it's actually quite big. I stayed here for one night to watch a concert in Singapore. We squeezed in 3 people in one room because the hotel was fully booked. We all slept comfortably with cold AC and really good shower. The location is obviously the best part of this hotel. It's just across from Paragon mall. Food and shopping were easy. Transportation especially easy. Will stay here again next time in Singapore.,1
annaZG,Best location,"This hotel is very close to shopping malls;?Paragon shopping mall is a place to have meals and some shopping. Our Room was comfortable and clean. We liked the breakfast (there was good selection of coffee). The area was veryvsafe at night and if you want to, it is possible to walk to Botanic Garden from the hotel. If you value cleanliness, appreciate that a hospital, shopping malls, cafes, restaurants and even a public library are nearby, and are not fussy over breakfast, you will enjoy staying in this property. We will certainly return.",4
Eat Fly Sleep Repeat,Camera missing,"I stayed here for a night for a business trip with shopping agenda. This hotel i highly recommend in terms of cleanliness, no fuss, and centrally located in orchard road close to all shopping and eating places. Check in and check out was quick. Breakfast was good. As an ihg member, i had an early check in and very late checkout. Great customer service! I did enjoy my stay here and will stay here again next time.",5

So I found my self in a very center of everything in Singapore and still peaceful and quite to relax after the exhausting sightseeing every day. Hotel is rather new and very clean. Rooms are really nice and breakfast was great. Staff at the hotel was very helpful and professional. And the price was like twice as cheap tjam the naerby hotels that provides you everything this one does. So I would say definately a best buy!",1
Sojanjs,Holiday Inn Express,"I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and on the 2nd last day we left our camera in our backpack in the room and when we came back that afternoon it was missing,it was the one day we left the camera in the room. We spoke to multiple people about it and all had different answers or the message wasn't passed onto to the manager every time we were told the same thing someone will come to your room and speak to you about this and every time no one came. Upon checking out we were reassured by the manager that there will be follow up and be contacted by email it's been over a month and we have heard nothing. When we first reported it the manager she was very nervous when we mentioned that we were going to put in a police report. I have lost my camera and all the memories from my",3

Douglas R,Value and Quality,"The overall quality is good. comfy beds, ample of electric sockets, free wifi ..etc. just there are so many inserts ( tiny flies) in the room that was so strange. They like to stick on towels and curtain. I suspect there should be some big inserts hiding somewhere to do the reproduction everyday. As those are not so annoying and not sticking on bed, I did not complaint as I do not stay at room for long in a business trip. BTW, the free breakfast has a wide variety but the food quality is very so so... I skipped breakfast in the last two days and find something delicious in the Paragon Mall",5
coolnadya,Good hotel with super location,"I needed to stay in the hotel closest to the Mt E Hospital. And wanting IN and OUT easy hotel. Receptions are always busy, and nothing much available as a facilities. Room is basic and simple. So dont expect fancy but expect clean, simple and fast.",4
Pojok Traveller,Essential needs in the heart of Orchard,"For the price and location you really can't beat the Holiday Inn Express just off of Orchard Road. This is a very efficient place to stay - check in is fast, rooms are easy to get to it in a swift elevator, easy to get out and about for shopping, medical visits to nearby Mount Elizabeth Hospital, or to the MRT which takes you anywhere. I've stayed at other, more expensive, ""five star"" hotels in the Orchard Road area and I can easily say the Holiday Inn Express is the best value that I'll keep coming back to. Very clean hotel, and breakfast just fine too, though not stupendous.",5
Glitz B,Fanatic stay,"I found a bit tricky to find this hotel at first, but the high tower with big signage helped finding this hotel. It just behind Abercombie & Fitch, next to Paragon. The room was big enough for an express hotel, clean, complete toiletries. The receptionist was very efficient when checking me in and out.",1
Bonny W,Overall Great Hotel Pick,"There is nothing fancy abou this hotel. No gym, No pool, no great view. But the location, room size, the things you need (amenities), and the comfort of the bed keep us coming back to this hotel whenever we need to be in Singapore for a short visit. The people here are friendly and they will accomodate our request to heir maximal extend. We value that. I'd reccomend you to register as their member and book through their websites for a special rate (cheaper than non-member rate). Well, if you travel most of the time in Singapore and you need a place to sleep better in Orchard, this hotel might be perfect for you.",4
litslits,Great Hotel,We stayed here at the end of January with two children for 3 nights as a stop over on our way to Fiji islands . Hotel is located just off orchard road so very convenient to get around . There is a bus stop and taxi stand near by too which makes it easy to make your way around the city . The hotel serves a good choice of breakfast which was Halal . So if your a Muslim then you need not to worry . There is a mosque directly opposite the hotel which is an advantage too . I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a short break and looking for something reasonably priced with out compromising on location and cleanliness of the hotel .,5
Dennis L,Newer Property with Good Location,"This hotel was awesome! Great customer service, great location. I would absolutely return.

Uzma W,Gem of a hotel,"I had an one-night stay here. The hotel‚Äôs location is quite good (especially if you are into shopping, which I am not). It is just off Orchard Road, which is main shopping area in Singapore lined with countless number of department stores. The hotel itself is a newer building and it is about a 5-10 minute walk to two subway stations (Orchard and Somerset, on the same line). I had a standard room with a queen bed. The room‚Äôs set up is very similar to other newer Holiday Inn / HI Express properties that I had stayed elsewhere. It is modern and clean. My only slight complaint was that the bedsheets and pillow cases seemed to have a pretty strong detergent smell (nothing too unbearable). One thing I like about Holiday Inn Express is that the soap and shampoo actually comes",1

I had requested for a higher floor a late check out & they provided a room on 16th floor which is the highest floor . Checked out at 2pm. No fuss. Even though the hotel is located in a service Lane but the hotel will call a taxi for you in seconds. Other hotels on Orchard Road should study the art of hospitality from this establishment.
