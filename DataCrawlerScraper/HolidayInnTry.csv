arsw1,Warm hospitality,"I had a good experience staying in this hotel. The front desk staffs are helpful and willing to listen. Staff member Reena is patient and willing to go the extra mile to accomodate us. The hotel room is simple, sufficiently sized, and was clean. The breakfast spread is not much, but enough to get us going in the morning.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"
beatrice390,ARROGANT FRONT DESK ATTITUDE!,"As an old and loyal costumer , I feel lots of changes with the services especially front desk team performance. Before pandemic, all front desk staffs fill with friendly and warm attitude toward guests , but unfortunately after 1 year closing all those front desk staffs are gone and replaced with arrogant and unfriendly staffs. My kid accidentally made a hot chocolate from coffee machine and one of front desk staff ( Mr. Wang Wei ) told me with angry tone and face ‚Äú Could you tell your son that you have to pay first before he could make that hot chocolate ?‚Äù And could you ask your kid to move away from that coffee machine before you make payment ?‚Äù üôÑ Well, I think next time hotel should put price list beside that coffee machine so guests will understand.

Connor P,Sustainable and Stylish with great Service!,"Shockingly overpriced budget university lodging standard. No pool, limited gym without aircon. Rooms small but clean.

Very poor experience for a 28 night stay.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"
Adhika Hardhanu,My first great experience stayed at here,The Holiday Inn Express Orchard Gateway is a great place to stay in a prime location.

fmoulsen,Thank you IHG EXPRESS Orchard,"Very convenient location where you can find food and cinema nearby. Also not too far from other hotspot locations in Singapore. Staff very helpful when you need some assistance. I have also accidentally left a valuable item upon checkout and the staff Mr Chester is very helpful in assisting me.

Itravel0ne,Convenient and good stay,"The small sister from Holiday Inn did not look like the big sister at all. Quite disappointed to be honest. I dont even know why they got the SG Clean label whereas it was totally different than what i found. First impression was the room was dirty, the main switch light had blood splattered, got hair stuck in between towels, lipstick mark on the coffee mug, stain marks on the bed sheet, room was heavy with dust, and worst of all? Promise not kept. I rang the hotel before booking if the hotel is willing to put plywood board underneath the mattress (normally to give more support), the receptionist said YES. i put this condition in writing too at the time of booking, and when i checked in at the hotel, receptionist also said YES. I kept asking for it, after a week of keep","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"

Room is well design as typical of the HIE. Staff are friendly and can‚Äôt fault any of the service except that the phone and safebox in the room was not working when we checked in.

BillyBrocha,Great service by Housekeeper Kelly,"Location of this hotel is perfect if you love to shop whether high end or not. Situated near Orchard road, walking distance to restaurants, shops, hospital, convenient stores. Staff are very accommodating to the extend that they offer free bottled water to guests. Free breakfast from 6:30-10:30am and you can have it take away if you wish. Unfortunately, there is no swimming pool, no bath tub in case that‚Äôs your requirement. I was not able to check if there is a fitness room. Over all, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and all staff show their smile while entertaining us. We will definitely patronize this hotel again.

We chose this hotel due to its location, as it is superbly located near Somerset MRT station and Singapore's finest shopping malls. Upon check-in, it was clear that service is absolutely spot on - professional, efficient and courteous. Adding another feather to this hotel's bow is the size of its rooms. The connecting rooms that we got was one of the biggest rooms I have seen for a HIE (bigger than some HIs in Europe!). The clean and ample space came with courteous room service staff. Another pleasant surprise was that the breakfast menu varies throughout the week with local specialties. The staff managed to find seats for us even during its peak hours.

Waitress Wang is so pleasant. Everyone served wtih a smile. I love the customer service of the staff. The hotel itself isn't so great but the service more than compensates for the buidling.

Michaelsim S,Excellent Hotel with good location on Orchard Road.,"To be honest, I have never taken notice of this hotel till I stayed here. Located off the main road, I am quite thankful it is away from the hustle and bustle. In fact, it is an oasis of peace and quiet. Checking in was easy and efficient, and the process was completed in less than 10 minutes. I had asked weeks before my arrival if my bicycle can be placed in the storage room, and the hotel nicely obliged. Nurul, at the front desk, made me feel welcomed quite immediately. I was told that to beat the crowd, having breakfast before 8am would be best, and that was what I did the morning after. I was very happy with my assigned room. It had all the guestroom and bathroom amenities a guest would possibly need. Scan a QR code in the room and information ranging from food menu","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

Sirjit,"Great service, Comfortable rooms","The room is pretty spacious compared to other Holiday Inns I stayed. Simple but adequate. Room is well taken care of. Bed is definitely comfortable. I dislike the bathroom. The door either close for the shower area or the entire bathroom. If u close for the shower area, it means the toilet bowl area is exposed. If u close the entire bathroom, u gonna wet the entire toilet too. It just doesn't make sense. Also, the room is a bit too close to the office building opposite. I can see workers hustling at their desk. I'm not sure if I am motivating them or demoralising them by having a vacation on a weekday!","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_10']"
Sun,Quarantine Stay,"I am on doubt about the good comments from Trips apps. Below are experinces which i met on first and second day of quarantine. Days 1: Due quarantine 10days, we are arranged to holiday inn for SHN. On first day of check-in, I met a male chinese security staff here who spoke to me rudely and order me not to sit on the chair same row with my spouse (even with 1 m apart). Out of this, when I enquire on SHN information regarding optional dedicated facilities matter but he replied with he dont know what is that rudely which has made us feel uncomfortable. He even approached me for asking why i looked at him. Really like a gangster. Day2: call to receptionist to ask for more mineral water but she is telling me that singapore water is clean and mineral water is second option","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"

John Cover,Quarantine,"When we received the quarantine order, we were worried about which facility we would be staying in, especially regarding the cleanliness and food provided. It was a huge relief stepping into a clean, big and comfortable room which would be our home for the next 10 days. The room looked very new and was equipped with all necessary amenities and most importantly, fast Wi-Fi. Fortunately, our room was brightly lit so the sun could shine in at times. We were impressed with how tasty the meals were. We could see the effort put into preparing the meals and encouragement notes. Kudos to the chefs and staff! The hotel team was polite and friendly.

Muhammad Hamzah,Quarantine,"I was so frustrated receiving a quarantine order considering that it was the month-end, and I was buried up to my neck with lots of work to do. Adding the anxiety because I was a close contact was not helping. However, I was relieved as soon as I stepped out of the van and saw where I would be staying. I'm an IHG Rewards Club member so I knew service would be top-notch. The entire process was so efficient, thanks to the SG govt and all the staff throughout. Truthfully, I wasn't disappointed, room is impeccably clean. Could hoped for a better view though, but who would complain for a free ""staycation"". The staff are so patient handling my food requests and bringing deliveries promptly.

Tourist667530,Great For Business and Shopaholic Travellers!,"Was assigned to serve my quarantine here for 14 days. Small but comfortable room. There are set meal times and the main let down was the consistently late delivery of the meals, at times up to 45 mins - 2, sometimes 3 out the 3 meals each day for the past 6 days so far have been late. Called the reception each time it was late and the replies were the same - it's on the way, coming up soon, sorry - will inform the manager etc. Can accept the occasional delay but every day for 6 days? Wonder if that will be the case for the remaining 8 days staying here. Being quarantined is already tough and to have this happening made it worse. Hope that the management can address this soon.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_30']"

MrtnVgt,Best of it‚Äôs kind,"Stayed five nights in late January at this hotel. The reason for choosing this hotel for my short break is the ideal location, close to quite a number of shopping malls and within walking distance to Somerset and Orchard MRT Stations. Check in was swift, the room, while small is adequate. The bathroom set up is quite unusual in that the bathroom glass door serves as a shower stall door and the main privacy door. The hotel has no inhouse restaurant or laundry service. The coin operated washing machines on the fourth floor is provided for guest use. The Great Room next to the Check In reception only provides a simple breakfast in the morning. In summary, this is a fuss free hotel where everything is self service and nothing more.

Also when we were having breakfast one of the chefs passed by and asked if everything was ok, where we were from etc, and wished us a good day.

It is clean, the staff are friendly, and the price isn't terrible, though we thought it was overpriced for what we got. We had two issues that made the hotel just average for us though. The first is the size of the bed. If it was a queen bed, as advertised, it is the smallest queen I've ever seen. My husband is quite tall (1 meter 88 or 6 foot 3 inches) and he barely fit length-wise and between his shoulders and my belly (7 months pregnant), we just fit width wise. We have a queen sized bed at home and we fit in it much better than we did this bed.

We go almost every year to Singapore and it is one of the best located hotel on Orchard road. It is right in the centre of Orchard road and very convenient for shopping. We used to stay in hotels further up Orchard road but they were quite far at the end of the road. The room was a bit small but very nice and clean. There is a complimentary breakfast and it gives a good variety of food. The attendants at breakfast are also very efficient and friendly. The staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. We booked the room for 8 nights well in advance and asked for an early check in whuch was not guaranteed and we were delighted to get the room at 9 am. That was fantastic after the long flight hours.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"
Heren SG,Good hotel next to shopping areas,Stayed here again for a few days last week and everything was as good as I expected from my previous stay here. Nice to know that the good standards are being maintained. Orchard Road is lit for the year-end holiday season and it's only a 30-second walk from the hotel to admire the bright lights.,"['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"
BobM08,Comfortable and convenient location,"We stayed 3rooms 8person. Not closed to subway but in center of orchard rd. Dinner not so much choice and price is very high. Breakfast is crowded, seats are not enough. Buffet line is fine and food fill up all the times. Has grab n go corner for bakery and fruits and coffee.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

Chee Lim W,Centrally located and value for money,"We stayed here for a couple of days during a short visit. This is not the best place for a quiet and relaxed holiday, as it was bustling with families on holiday and young visiting business people. But it was good value for money, with functional guest rooms, a decent breakfast spread and great location. Service was friendly, from check-in to check-out. The hotel has very convenient access to some of the best malls around Orchard Road, i.e. Paragon, Mandarin Gallery, Takashimaya, Wisma Atria and Ion, and even Wheelock Place with a hidden gem of a restaurant which we stumbled upon during our stay (see separate review on Pistachio Mediterranean Grill!). It was a short walk too to the MRT stations of Orchard and Somerset, and the bus stop across from the Mandarin.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"

Angelo,Excellent location,"It is always our go-to hotel whenever we visit Singapore. Given that it is located right in Orchard, the price of the rooms are reasonable. It averages at SGD230 per room per night (including tax). The room comes with complimentary breakfast and complimentary drinks as well. Breakfast has a good spread too and it is open until 11am! So great for those who wake up late. The toilet is a little small and it shares door with the shower. Thats the only downside. Otherwise, the room size is good!","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_10']"
jaimepage77,Great Hotel Great Location,"We stayed at this establishment from 01 November to 04 November 2019. We were given a room on 15th floor, so it was the second highest floor for this hotel. From the moment we checked in, the service has been great. Free bottle of water was provided by the room service. Also, when the chambermaid, Kelly, cleaned the room, it was done very efficiently. It was not our first time we stayed at this hotel, and it never fails to please us. No need to mention about the location as it's only, literally, a stone throw away from Orchard Road. Breakfast is included in the rate, and it can get very busy past 7:30am, but the hotel replenish the food fairly quickly. The only not so good experience we had was with the washing machines as both of them broke down when we were there. However, the","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_30']"

We stayed on the 16th floor , very quiet and clean , if there is only a drawback , then it should it be the lobby and reception area , it can be a bit noisy and cramp during certain hours of day ( check in and check out time ) , otherwise I would be coming back to stay at this hotel","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_10']"
Flofif,"Excellent, the most recommended hotel in spore","I would recommend this hotel and look forward to going back for a second bite. Location was brill, rooms were lovely, the staff were awesome, the breakfast was perfect, and it was reasonably priced. Getting around was a breeze, with fairly easy access to Somerset MRT, though it is a bit of a rabbit hole in finding your way in and out! Shopaholics, shopping is literally on your doorstep. Have fun!","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

Werner D,Express,"I've been travelling to singapore so many time. And this is the best hotel ive been staying so far. Located in the heart of the famous orchard boulevard just behind the apple store building. The room was clean, the housekeeping clean the room everyday clearly. The front desk staff was friendly & helpfull. The bed was comfy with firm & soft pillows. The safe deposit box & refrigerator was also provided. For moslem, this hotel is very moslem-tourist-friendly. The hotel provide us with halal certified food in breakfast buffet. There is also qibla sign in the room. The toilet equipped with bidet shower. Just in front of the hotel is Al Falah mosque. I do recommend this hotel to stay in singapore.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"
Daniele A,nothing special,Location is great walking distant to shopping centers. Very impress with maid service on the first day. She really help me tidy up my messy stuff because I had to hurry for work. So once back to the room it is ready for me rest. Also even the breakfast is not much choices but flexiblity for grab and go is actually work well for me. I had nice 10 days stay here.,"['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

shanelle182,World class service only Singapore can deliver,"We are staying here for 6 nights for the Singapore GP. We normally stay at much more luxurious hotels, so while this is not a 5 star hotel by any means it great for a number of reasons: 1. Amazing location, right behind Apple store (50m walk from Orchard rd). Also only a short 5 minute walk to Somerset train station. Also there's a great supermarket bottom level at Paragon shopping centre which is only 200m away if you want food, drinks, etc. 2. Beds are very comfortable (queen size) 3. Rooms are quiet (we stayed on level 6 and had no noise) 4. Breakfast was good. Not huge by any means but a good variety to choose from. 5. Price was fantastic especially for location and during GP Note this hotel doesn't have a pool if you are after a hotel with one. 110% would stay here","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

As soon as you check in until you check out the staff was very polite and extremely helpful in every way possible. The breakfast room and kitchen staff were also excellent. Everything was clean and tasteful. The menu varied every morning with delicious dishes. The room was very clean and the cleaning staff was very attentive to our needs. This hotel was very close to everything: malls, restaurants, metro, etc. You cannot ask for anything better. So glad we stayed here on our first trip to Singapore! We'll definitely stay there again!","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_10']"

ruchac2017,Fantastic location,"The hotel is within 3 min walk from the busy Orchard Road malls, restaurants, food courts and retail stores. Room is middle size and bathroom is clean. There is an unique phone on the desk ( not own by HI) but someone else. This is like a cell phone and you can take with you when you move around the city. You can make free local or international calls, but people can't call you back. Good when you don't have local sim card for local calls. A lot more features but I have no time to explore more.You can check out locals restaurants and store, but it stated that they collect all your datas. Breakfast is fair, but staff are very courteous and a rather big lobby for an Express.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_10']"
GMU,Good Budget hotel in the centre of Orchard Rd,"Extremely average service. Great location to get around the shopping area and access to the MRT.

Haney,"Nice hotel, good location","The property is located in a vibrant and bustling locality. As it is just a five-minute walk from Somerset MRT, reaching it from Changi airport was a breeze. Besides, we did not have to use a cab at all; Somerset is pretty centrally located. The room was very clean. I usually get a dust allergy on my travels abroad, but I did not sneeze here. The breakfast was basic and adequate. The staff was very courteous. All in all, value for money.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"

They have decent breakfast which is open till 1130; it‚Äôs multi cuisine and the staff are friendly. Room size is small and the bathroom is basic. The shower pressure is no good (due to water saving measures). They have a washing machine on level 4 for laundry. Overall a decent stay - stayed for 5 days.,"['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_40']"

I do appreciate the hospitality of the staff. Didn't get her name, but she was very attentive and helpful when I asked for MRT going to Marina Bay Sand Theatre. She mentioned there were 2 options, but suggested to take the simpler one though might be longer. For this she handed me a note to help me remember. Thanks!

First night was quite noisy (7th floor) staff very helpful and moved me to 12th floor much better from a noise perspective. Housekeeping to a very high standard, small functional gym was spotless.

Selwyna V,Home away from home,"This is a great location if you are looking for something close to shopping centers and restaurants. It is smack down in the middle of Orchard road where all the prime shops are located. A 10 min walk away from the train station so not so bad. Rooms are clean, comfortable bed, and very sustainable hotel if I may add. Easy to get a taxi and staff is very accommodating. I did not give it a 5 star just because the options for food are not that many and area of the restaurant is not that big. Still, a great restaurant for anyone travelling on business and needs to be in the city area.","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"
kokboon04,Good location,Stayed here again earlier this week and it was exactly how I remembered my previous stay - great !!

dito99,Just Accross Al Falah mosque,"In comparison to Holiday Inn City Centre i much prefer the City Centre coz the rooms are larger, wide array of choices at buffet breakfast, toiletries is complete. But as to the staff, i think its standard in every Holiday Inn, that everyone is so accomodating with your every request, everyone is kind and always serve you with a smile. The location is a dream, only a minute or 2 and you are at Orchard Road. Rooms are spic and span, they have 4 pillows for twin sharing one sft and one firm and get this...they provide you with your own cellphone! You can use it anyway you want, call local and international, google or socmed to your hearts content!! This hotel has an answer to all your needs. I highly recommend all Holiday Inn hotels in Singapore, double thumbs upüëçüëç","['ui_bubble_rating', 'bubble_50']"
