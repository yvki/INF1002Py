nancyb8302016,Nice Hotel,"I stayed in a two bedroom, ocean front room and it was very large and lovely. The main complaints I have are that our ocean front view windows were FILTHY -- could not enjoy the view at all. (Bathroom floor was very dirty, too.) Part of the cleaning service between guests should include inside and outside cleaning of at least ocean view windows. They look like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Also, while sitting on the patio eating breakfast early one morning, the lawn service came around cutting and blowing and not caring that we were sitting there. We had to move our breakfast inside which was quite annoying.",4
snourous,Very Disappointing,"Location excellent. Provided complimentary soft drinks and water. That's the plus points out the way. Room and building smell terribly musty. The building is very tired and in desperate need of investment. We booked a deluxe room, there was NOTHING deluxe about our room. The bathroom was the tiniest we have ever seen, it's basically a closet with a shower, toilet and sink shoe horned in. If you are anywhere near 6 feet tall you'll hit your head on the wall if you attempt to sit on the toilet ! Bizarrely the Pantai provided bath salts, no idea why. The in room safe was rusty and didn't work. Reported it to the 'Manager' twice, who stated would be with us momentarily - he never showed, couldn't be bothered tending to his Customers I guess. We liked La Jolla and will return but to",1
Catalina G,Best customer service in La Jolla!!!,,5
Fran,Not what it’s cracked up to be,"First off, let me just start by saying Edwin the GM was extremely hospitable and accommodating! My family and I wanted to stay in very specific rooms since we have stayed here many times and know which ones we like. I don’t know how people have left reviews on here saying they didn’t receive house keeping!?! Anytime we needed anything, boom they were right there!! They provided beach equipment, which was a big deal since we traveled from AZ. They even had family games like Jenga and Monopoly! We will definitely keep coming back! Staying at The Pantai Inn has become a family tradition. I wish everyone could just stop and appreciate the history and beauty of that property! Yes they may be older buildings, but that’s part of what makes this place so special! Gregory Peck used",1

MIKE M,Summer at the beach,-No elevator- had to drag suitcases up 2 long flights of stairs. -Very limited Pantai inn parking that we pay for. -Iron with no board -No safe to store valuables -No closet in the room -Bathroom very small -Nightstand with lamp and no plug anywhere near to be plugged in. -The partial view was smushing your face against the window to get a sideways glimpse of the ocean. -This was a deluxe room -Asked for housekeeping and they never showed. We were the third complaint. -Breakfast included but was closed for 2 days. -Across the street from the ocean and the beach traffic was insane. -Heads up.. La Jolla is very hilly.,3
cnh5044,Stay somewhere else,"We were fortunate to have a room with a balcony facing the ocean. The room was spacious and the view was spectacular. Edwin the manager, was cheerful and so accommodating. From the cool drinks offered in the lobby to the great breakfast, we were treated very well. The hotel is close to many restaurants and beaches. Top notch!",1
Nector N,Excellent service,"This was my 3rd summer vacation at the Pantai Inn. The Inn has been through different owners recently. The new owner has raised the room rates comparable to several high quality hotels nearby. With the exception of some of the views and location of the rooms the property itself does not warrant the increased prices. New changes included daily parking rates, no pets permitted and no longer stays than 25 days. The showers need better drainage as they flood the bathroom. Pleasant staff for the most part. A breakfast has been added Thursday thru Sunday. Nice addition, but most rooms have a kitchen for making a quick cereal or egg meal. I suggest putting the money spent on the breakfast buffet towards improving the bathrooms with better drainage and shelving. DMMcGinley",5
Natascha T,Will never be back,"We were initially very excited to stay here because we loved the location. We decided to park our car (for an additional fee which was not explained prior to booking, they make it sound like parking is included). The next morning we came out to find damage to our car. The tire was damaged so badly we had to replace it. So after spending $720 to get repairs we contacted the hotel and asked if they had security footage for our insurance claim. They don’t have cameras by the parking. I then asked if they would be willing to refund my parking fee since parking with them cost me a lot of money but also an entire morning and afternoon of my vacation getting my car repaired so I could safely drive it. They declined and when I put my husband on to speak with the manager they hung up on",1

sherryze,Charming hotel but desperately understaffed,"Beautiful hotel right above LA Jolla's beachfront. . Although there was an issue with the air conditioning, the hotel supervisor did everything right to fix the issue, great service from everyone of the staff. Reccomend this hotel due to its location, atmosphere and service.",4
Asad_Traveler,Beautiful place!,"We paid $400 a night (without all the extra fees and parking) and our room was more than basic, and that's putting it kindly. I booked a room on a ""higher level"", which in this case meant, almost street level, but you had to go up a few stairs as the hotel is on a slope. I booked partial ocean view, and the hotel clerk showed the ocean to me by standing way back in the corner by the window and pointing somewhere outside. I literally had to laugh because it was so preposterous. Our bathroom was small but good and the nicest thing about the room were the Lather products. We had no room service during our two night stay, which nobody told us but I am sure was due to COVID (what isn't blamed on COVID)? It was VERY loud outside our room so we couldn't open the window, also our door",1
Ouida W,Great as always,,5
HSIU C W,gorgeous ocean view and desirable location,"Room 123 has great sunset. Enjoyed the complimentary Pantai coffee, water, beach towels and umbrella. Walked a mile to decent beach sand. Breakfast Thursday but not Wednesday. No fruit other than bananas. Great linens, mini fridge, microwave but no shower gel. Weather was awesome for patio and walking to shop and eat. Complementary parking and laundry. We are now fans of San Diego!",1
JanOct0810,Super clean and friendly spot to enjoy La Jolla,"I wasn't sure what to expect as the reviews are so mixed on this place. Let me preface by saying that they are understaffed. I called numerous times and emailed stay@pantai.com because I had questions prior to our stay, calls went unanswered, I never received a call back despite leaving voicemails, and email also went unanswered. Location could not be better, right across from Scripps Park and the beach. The seals/sea lions were only a 5 minute walk away. We spent 4th of July weekend here, in rooms 101 and 123. 101 is very spacious, but the bathroom is very small with no counter space. Beautiful bathroom design, poor execution. There is nothing to stop the water from soaking the entire bathroom floor when you shower. Full kitchen was well appointed with everything you could",5
Marc H,Lovely place,"After reading all the amazing reviews for the hotel, we had high expectations for Pantaii Inn. Amazingly, our expectations were exceeded on our trip! The hotel is located perfectly right next to the cove where you can witness sea lions and seals, exotic birds and so much other marine life. It’s also next to beach areas where you can enjoy the beautiful waters of La Jolla. The hotel itself is luxurious and clean. I am posting several photos which include exterior photos but also photos of our room — 121. This room was perfect for our family of 4 with a bedroom and a spacious sitting room as well. House keeping is available daily on request and the staff is attentive to any questions. Edwin and Tiffany were particularly so helpful. You can actually have the hotel do your",3
Getbusyliving,So much more potential,"As usual we had a delightful stay at Pantai Inn. This was our 5th time to stay there, and it is always such a unique experience. We like the small boutique hotel with more square footage and a kitchen in lieu of a 5-star luxury hotel with valet parking. We usually stay in a one bedroom with a porch/balcony overlooking the ocean. Some of the amenities this place has to offer include: relaxing chairs in lawn area with view of the Pacific Ocean, friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, fire pit for nightly visits with other guests, delicious breakfast buffet, and most of all LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. You can walk to the grassy park and along the coastline every morning, walk downtown for shopping and have many choices of restaurants. The new owner and staff are",1
ALFreundl,Truly a wonderful and hidden gem!,"We had the largest two-bed room suite, room 101. Only issue is the window shade, I addressed to the general manager, Edwin. He contacted me he would take it as his priority to replace the defective blind. Pantai Inn is located at La Jolla Cove. We enjoyed the ocean breezing while seating at balcony. The breakfast was great with a few of hot choice and fresh fruit. Parking is $25 per vehicle. The kitchenette had an oversize refrigerator, burner cooktop, and microwave. Rooms are comfortable and we had a pleasant stay at Pantai Inn.",5
Karole D,Pantai Inn isn't what it used to be,This lovely little oasis has a friendly staff and an amazing location. The rooms were literally spotless... even down to the wine glasses. We loved staying here and would come again! We especially loved the courtyard and the cold waters and soft drinks.,1
Mell P,Great views and Customer service excellence!,"Exquisite décor, clean and cozy. We stayed for 4 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. The location is also excellent! Loved the fireplace and we used the full kitchen. The bathroom was also classy. Would stay there again in a heartbeat!",4
Toby M,A great place to escape!,"Can’t get much better of a location in La Jolla. If you have a view of the water it will be great. This Inn has so much potential but, sadly, has been neglected and is not being run very well today. There is clearly a need for repairs and updates around the property. We had the largest suite on property and it was average but has the potential to be spectacular. We received no housekeeping, nor notice that we wouldn’t, during our entire stay. When we asked if they had breakfast in the morning the front desk response was “sometimes”. Parking is extremely limited and tight, something to be aware of. I can’t say you will go wrong with this Inn given it’s location but beware that it’s in need of TLC and support staff.",4
mwhendley,Nice location but Beware,"Very helpful and accommodating staff! We had a better-than-expected view and a very large unit with a full kitchen. Great location and walking distance to everything you could want…..shops, restaurants, the beach (seals!). Tip: call ahead to see if early check in is available and parking may be a little tight, but it all will work out. Very quiet for sleeping and our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer! Will definitely be back!",1
Julie P,Pantai Inn La Jolla,"This was our 5th time staying at the Pantai Inn. The last time we stayed was in Feb 2020 right before COVID squashed travelling. Since then the hotel has come under new management. No longer serving breakfast and no housekeeping. We stayed in room 204 which was our least favorite of the rooms we have stayed in. I can't blame that on them, it was all that was available when we booked. The bathroom, kitchen and bedroom are small and hard to navigate. The view is minimal and there is no balcony. Just know this rooms limitations if you book 204. The staff is nice and they do your laundry for free, just know it will be washed and dryed but not folded so you want to be available when it's delivered so you can fold it before it gets wrinkled, Not a complaint, we were very",5
Tigger H,Celebrating Birthday,"I stayed at this property for my birthday weekend celebration. From my very first contact with this property, the customer service I received was exceptional! I made a couple phone calls prior to arrival and each interaction was equally pleasant and accommodating. I received thorough information and all the relevant details to make the check-in and stay a seamless process. Edwin Z, the General Manager, was extremely helpful in providing excellent recommendations for activities that made my birthday celebration a complete success! From extra linens, to dining recommendations, the staff was always willing to fill our requests and provide helpful information. The property is in a perfect location and was clean and well kept. It made me feel like I was on an island getaway.",1
Cara,Great stay!,A great place to stay to end a busy week. The staff was great as was the room. We acted on the staff recommendations to eat at The Cottage for breakfast and Puesto for dinner. Both were excellent recommendations. An afternoon in the sunshine laying on provided beach towels was exactly what we needed. Checking in early wa not a problem and the open lobby was a great place to hang out.,5
L W,Edwin is the best!,"The Staff was pleasant and the outdoor sitting area was relaxing. Sleeping was not possible one night as the doors rattled from the wind. While the view was beautiful from the studio , there was barely room enough to move about. Beware, the final bill was never sent as stated and when it was requested, it did not match what was charged on the credit card. The manager was most unhelpful in resolving this issue,",3

This is a charming older boutique hotel. It is directly across the street from the cove and beach access. The hotel is clean and well kept. The staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in room 321, a one bedroom, which is building across from the lobby. The room had an ocean view. There was a small balcony with terrific view of the ocean and the park across the street.

FITraveler1011,The Pantai Inn - Unique and completely off the charts!,"Great location on the ocean, has always been a tired looking hotel, but now the service is gone too. Stayed in room 208 for 3 nights for my wife’s 70th birthday. We got here during a change in ownership and nothing seemed to be working right. No housekeeping during a 3 night stay. Asked why, “It’s on request.” Seems like for $549/night asking for a hotel basic shouldn’t be necessary. You expect that from Airbnb. ""Here's your key, see you in 3 days!"" Fireplace didn’t work. Patio furniture needed replacing. They are riding on that incredible view of the ocean. They need to either improve the experience to match the price, or lower the price to match the experience. Everyone is pleasant and willing to fulfill any request. Except most things you should just get, not have to",4
Andrew W,Pantai Inn,Lori from housekeeping did an amazing job customer service. Provides extra towels and condiments immediately when requested. She stopped what she was doing and made me feel welcomed. Lori also knew I was visiting and recommended several high level places to visit and eat! Thank you so much,1
jessod619,A little taste of Bali,"I really had a hard time rating this hotel. First of all, the location is really wonderful - right across the street from the ocean and some of the best views of the cove walk. It was also a short walk up to the main town area for food and shopping. Everyone at the hotel seems nice, I really like the decor and it was nice that the room included both a bedroom and a sitting room. Now for the “bad:” First my room had a malfunctioning toilet. (I think it was room 224) I didn’t find out until later at night when I first used it that it did not work. Someone came and fixed it - but unfortunately when I tried it again later on it did not work again. I had to get up in the middle of the night and wander around the outdoor courtyard area looking for a bathroom at 4am. It wasn’t very",5
sshular86,"Tired room, busy location, great staff","My husband and I stayed at the Pantai Inn Monday-Friday in room 222. This review is based on our experience in this specific room. Pros: - All of the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Each person was beyond welcoming and had great customer service! - The location was perfect! We walked all over La Jolla, and up and down the path along the ocean. - We had an ocean front room with a balcony, and I felt like out of all the hotels in La Jolla, we got the most bang for our buck here! The view from our window was perfect. - Our room had a mini kitchen with a fridge, microwave, and glassware. This was SO great to have because we were able to eat left overs from restaurants and not have to eat out for every meal. - The bed was comfy, not too soft and not too hard. - The",1
Jim K,Worst Booking Experience of All Time,"This is our second visit here to the Pantai Inn, and certainly won’t be the last! First of all, let me tell you what this place is NOT! If you want a place who will valet park you Lambo, this place probably isn’t for you. If you want to ring up the bell boy for some tea to be delivered, if you want a large pool, cabana, or a private hot tub, just… don’t even think about this place. There are thousands of those places (I like them too) all over the world and in San Diego as well - have at it by all means, just don’t expect that here! What the Pantai Inn is about are things difficult to put a price tag on. The hotel is one of the most unique in California, each and every room is different. The views of the ocean, the sunsets, the sounds of the sea lions at night and in the",5
177jakedog,Best location,"The hotel was in a great location, town was 5 minutes away as was La Jolla Cove. The staff were wonderful, extremely accommodating and always pleasant. There is a lovely outdoor area with a fire pit and tables that can be used for outdoor dining . I booked a return stay next year",3
bluhorizan,Disappointed,"We've traveled to Bali many times. So it was a treat for us to see a place themed out in it here in San Diego. This hotel was a great boutique experience. Accommodating, friendly and comfortable. They made us feel welcomed. The room spacious and made it easy to have friends over to visit. We had a good time hanging outside on the patio. Great location and close to shell beach and the childrens pool. We will be back!",1
Tom R,Great location and great staff,"First of all, the staff was very accommodating, really great people and genuinely concerned about their guests. The grounds are beautiful! The room however (123) was just not what I’d expect for $500+ per night (I know you pay for location). Dated and tired. We found a dirty towel left in the room which the staff felt horrible about, pretty sure the sheets on the foldout were not fresh nor a blanket for it and the blinds in both rooms were broken and ‘ratty’. Not being overly picky, but again, for $500+.. My only complaint and this is not the hotels problem, it gets very busy in front on the room. Being a first floor our view was largely blocked during the day including an RV (couple selling jewelry in the park) that parked on the street right in front of our room for two",5
FATH169,Nice weekend getaway,"We've booked hundreds of rooms in our lives and no experience has been more frustrating than spending NINE hours of my day today to try to get someone to return my call or email to cancel my reservation on the last day of refund eligibility. I even resorted to calling their parent company and nearby hotels, fearing that perhaps there was something terrible happening at the property. Then, on my 22nd call attempt, at 4:30pm, I'm greeted by a snippy woman with zero empathy who was as curt as I'd expect given the day long neglect. I mean, here was the chance for an employee to be a hero and ""turn us around"" on the awful experience, but nope. Not even close. Who knows, maybe they had a legit reason that all contact channels were all down?! Needless to say, we will NEVER book a room",1
drpsyc,Don't come if you can't climb stairs!,This is a beautiful property. We loved our accommodations. Highly recommend. The little apartments are very comfortable. We enjoyed the fire pit. My parents had a waterfront room with beautiful big windows to enjoy the view. We couldn’t have been happier.,4
peiwei,Old furnitures,"This property has a mix of rooms, apartments and cottage which are ideally located across Coast Drive and the ocean. I've stayed here before for business and there is a wonderful ambiance in the center courtyard and the front desk staff offer 5 star service in many respects. Unfortunately this trip left us quite disappointed with the dated accommodations and the very high cost of our 3 night stay. Excited with booking ocean view room with outside patio! Second floor unit 210: 1 bedroom apartment in an older brown shingled building with an unimpeded view of the Pacific Ocean. However inside, the dated carpets, small bathroom, bedroom and kitchen could have been mistaken for a Motel 6. The bathroom sinks didn’t drain on first use but front desk staff responding promptly. The",4
Steve Murray,Great view but so-so room,"We loved our stay at Pantai Inn. The excellent location is right on the coast in La Jolla, walking distance from great restaurants such as Puesta and Cantania. It is a nice property with great artistic touches and the exceptional staff are friendly and happy to help. Morning room service is very reasonably priced and they have a nice selection of wines so you can enjoy a bottle while watching the sunset from the balcony. As noted in other reviews, the rooms could use an update. Some of the furniture is dated, but it is not unlike living in an older seaside home. I see there are notes from the inn that they have updates planned, which will be welcomed, but I would gladly stay here again whether or not they update the furnishings. I hope they keep all of the great art.",1
kitty32655,Boutique hotel with stunning ocean front views and friendly staff,Unbeatable location. Very pleasant staff. Only thing is outdated. Would likely need a face lift. I feel the location surely makes up for the cosmetic need. Easy checking and out. Very clean overall. I will go their again when in the area.,5
C Pascua,Quaint and clean,"Primary good service. Room was covered by chipped paint, too small single paned window, bird doo on the picture window, rusted bar sink, and a bathroom that you can touch the toilet, sink, and tub from one place. Not worthy of $400 plus per night. And, if you have mobility issues, such as arthritic knees, specify this at time of booking as there is no elevator.",1
Ryan Justin R,Wedding Anniversary ❤️,"The people that works at the front desk are really nice. But the room that we had I believe is 205 ( one of the ocean front room), the living room sofa is really old and I actually don’t feel comfortable sitting on it so I need to placed towels on the sofa. The carpet is old as well, I would prefer wooden floor. The bathroom faucet needs deep cleaning, soap scum! We stayed during the Covid time. We are healthy after our stay but I was a bit afraid. The location is great, but with too many tourists right in front of your door steps. The hotel needs a lot of update. I think I would still prefer staying at Coronado island area. I am sorry to say that I will not come back to this hotel.",5
khnguyen101,Love it!,"As advertised, the room we booked had a great view of the La Jolla Bay. It was centrally located, close to nice restaurants and coastal sights. However, the room was not ready when we arrived in the late afternoon. The staff was apologetic and allowed us to park for free. We were disappointed to learn that breakfast was no longer served due to Covid. Our room was comfortable but the bathroom was very small with no racks to hang our wet towels. During the night we could hear the guests above us walking around.",3
tdo25,I guess “you get what you pay for...?”,"The Pantai Inn is directly across from the beach. We had an ocean front room with balcony (#322) which had a full ocean view (even from the bed). The room had a mini kitchenette (fridge, microwave, coffee maker and faucet) with plenty of counter space and cupboards. There was a table, desk, comfy chairs and a large TV. The bathroom was on the small side, but the decor was very interesting. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Check in time is 3:00 pm, but we arrived at noon and our room was already ready. The hotel is in a great location! It's about a 5 minute walk to the center of town (Prospect Street) and directly across the street from the beach. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",1
Shinelight932,EXCELLENCE IN LA JOLLA!,"This is our second stay here, and unfortunately due to covid, a few amenities have been halted. When we arrived an hour after check-in, our room was not ready. We missed that the breakfast was cancelled and never had the chance to use the car service to the beaches. We're also celebrating an anniversary, but there were not any special treats to great us as there was on our birthday. We had some trouble with our porch lock, but thankfully the guest service in the office was able to fix it by the second day. The service is friendly and as accommodating as can be during such times. Just learn what their updated amenities are before you book. We'll probably try again next year.",5

From the breathtaking ocean view, jacuzzi, heart shaped rose pedals on the bed, champagne, dessert, everything in the suite was just wonderful. Pantai Inn made our Anniversary very special. Can’t wait to come back. Also a big thank you to Ashley-very grateful for your hospitality!",1
hotpepperstudio,Bicycle trip in La Jolla,"Pantai Inn is perfect for short day staycations. Cool hotel theme with gorgeous view to the beach. It made me feel like home because it offered a living room and kitchen within the room, which I think is a huge plus compared to other places. The service was beyond outstanding with friendly staff and complementary drinks. The only thing I didn’t expect (but not complaining) was that the room size was quite smaller than the pictures and the amenities were pretty basic. However, I would totally come back, maybe for a weekend getaway, hopefully to get some different cool experiences from here.",4
almadtorr,Best experience by the beach,"It is a beautiful place with an extraordinary location. The gardens are exquisite and the staff is very personable/knowledgeable and mask compliance is high. I figured on staying at Pantai for my first night in CA after a cross country solo drive. What went wrong? I booked the night before from AZ and was warmly welcomed on arrival and perhaps the price $200+ should have been a clue for the last room available. They have a handful of buildings and my room was in the back of the squared off one facing 1) the road; 2) the parking lot; and 3) the stairway in to the building. The furnishings were fine, the bed comfortable but it felt much more monastic than Balinese. Take a look at the photos.",4

Charming, beachside (across street from sand), like being in a cabin but upgraded, with fireplaces in rooms, so beautifully Balinese! Our 8 year old loved it! We loved it!

Next day the front desk rep when asking for something, who we had never met, said, Happy Birthday Mrs. E! I was shocked! The communication was amazing! A gem of a hotel...",1
Beth K,Great Location,We had such a wonderful experience the 1st time we had to return. Not only is this a prime location close to everything within walking distance...

Easy walk to downtown La Jolla restaurants, shops, etc. Pre-covid they do an incredible chef breakfast. Rooms are on the older side, but still very clean and charming.

I have even brought my 2 kiddos along on occasion for a family trip as the hotel is family-friendly and there is lots to entertain little ones nearby.",3
abrazarlupe,birthday vacation.,Nice boutique hotel. Unable to book a specific room. This was at least my 4th stay and this time I was not able to book a specific studio. We were given the studio right off the street / sidewalk and it felt a bit unsafe and bright with the flood lights at night. I don't think I would stay again unless I could pick a specific studio.,1
Jeremiah G,Excellent Find,I brought my fiance here as a surprise for Valentine's day. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6. 1. The website said the room had a panoramic Ocean view. This was completely false. It had a sliver of an ocean view from one angle in the room and not an area you would sit or lie. The panoramic view was of the hotel and the constant stream of pedestrian traffic that walked by our window- forcing us to keep the shades draw. No mention of that on the website. 2. The room was positioned right on the street where hippies park their cars and busses and blare psychedelic music for 18 hours of the day. It comes right through the walls so you are forced to hear it and pollutes your space and conversations. The hotel staff was very aware of the nuisance and said it had been a constant,5

GrinGary,Great Hotel,"A friend and I shared a two-bedroom oceanfront room for three nights at the Pantai Inn. We loved the location, the open layout of the living room, dining area with its large round glass table, the kitchen, sun room, and convenient parking by the door. The staff was friendly, helpful, and responsive to our requests. The lobby has complimentary water and soft beverages as well as large long-stemmed wine glasses for guest use. A limited number of good wines are for sale. The outside seating area is inviting with wonderful ocean views.

mattdreese,Beautiful and Beachy.,Perfectly located practically on the beach. Amazing views. Seals to the left. Sea lions to the right. The staff are amazing and it was very clean and safe. The rooms are a bit dated but very large and have everything you need.,5
cindycarolinaortiz75,Excellent stay,"We just finished moving out of our home and needed REST. We stayed for two nights of luxury and renewal at this amazing resort that takes you to a special place to restore mind, body and spirit. YES we will return because it's so magical and the staff is SUPERB!",3
dghardy760,Excellent Beach Front,Beautiful hotel. And the staff was incredible! Checkin was easy. We were not able to go to Resturants but the staff made sure we could order a meal and had it delivered. We only stayed one night but plan to return in the future. Clean and beautiful property,1
Jgrammatic,Didn't Live up to Expectation,"we returned for our second stay at the Pantai Inn. We love the hotel and location and plan to return. We did notice that our room is in need of some minor maintenance and cleaning. I was tempted to take it on myself, but I didn't. Some minor things such as window blinds that no longer operate, bedroom door stop separating from door jam, walls that need a thorough cleaning near bathroom, screws coming loose on the backdoor lock mechanism. All minor things that didn't interfere with our enjoyment, but just some items that should be addressed before they get worse. Overall, a great stay at a great hotel.",5
Chris O,Absolutely miserable!,The staff was incredibly friendly. The location was PERFECT. Walking distance to just about everything. The price was reasonable and can’t wait to make it a yearly event and bring my family to stay again.,1

Olga Perez,Best Ocean View,Front desk manager was very accommodating and the view was amazing. The room linens were very soft and I the rooms are very well decorated. But the fire pit really was my favorite area to hangout while it’s got great running areas nearby on the ocean.,4
LoveServeInspire,Best View and Location in La Jolla!,"Unfortunately our experience at the Pantai Inn was not as great as some of these other reviewers. First and foremost we really were expecting more of a luxury hotel but to be honest we found the this place to be just a glorified motel. There is no restaurant or food service . The room itself while large, felt very old and kind of smelled a little bit funky. Extremely overpriced in my opinion. Looking back the best thing by far about our stay was the location which is essentially across the street from the beach, however it was EXTREMELY crowded. Basically you can walk to the beach and all the local tourist attractions from the hotel and that is a big plus. Although the front desk was very friendly and tried to accommodate all our needs it just did not live up to the 5 star",1
randallkaye,Bali meets Southern California,"My wife and I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights based on TripAdvisor reviews. I was skeptical to stay here after looking at the pictures but the reviews won us over. I arrived and was treated very well by the staff. However, when taken to my one bedroom ocean view room I was completely shocked. The room smelled appalling and the place was in very poor condition. I’m a discerning traveler who as been fortunate enough to travel to many beautiful hotels in six continents. I can’t travel internationally because of Covid so we tried La Jolla. I immediately went to reception and offered to leave if I would only be charged for one night not two. The receptionist was very helpful and professional about the situation agreeing to only change for one night. I left the hotel",5
tbe663849,great time,"Overall, I would stay here again! It's beautiful, we were able to park our car within sight of our cottage during our one-night Mini-Honeymoon, and the Sweetheart package upgrade we received (champagne on ice/rose petals in our room etc) was a good value for the price. We also enjoyed complimentary beverages from the lobby cooler during our stay, and a community fire pit that became private due to fewer travelers during coronavirus. Now the not-so good: we arrived in the area at 2pm, fully knowing that check-in as at 3pm. We had no problem at all with waiting, since we were obviously an hour early, but we ran into an issue when the room was not ready by 3pm because frankly, we'd had a long drive, and really really needed to use a bathroom! However, once we were in the room",1
Mamabear,Great Location,"Upon arrival we met w the girl at the front desk and I’m sorry to forget her name but she was such a sweetheart. Management, please know she made our stay that much better because if her sweet and kind demeanor. We stayed in a charming cottage on the Northern part of the property. Adequate space for a small family. Complimentary parking right next to our room which is a huge plus since most times you have to pay an insane fee and don’t have access to you car. This was by far one of the most convenient parts of our stay. The bathroom was very clean but clearly some upgrades need to be completed. The carpets are thick with muck, and might be sand, but that’s the only thing about the interior that bothered me. It’s especially hard when you have a baby who’s crawling. We managed.",5
DON Z,Pantai Inn in La Jolla,"My husband and I enjoyed a beautiful birthday weekend getaway in La Jolla. We loved our room (323) and gorgeous ocean view and balcony! The bed was also very comfortable. When we made our reservation (via phone) there was no mention of breakfast not being served. We were looking forward to this. We know the resort fee was waived, but we believe parking should have been waived as well, or a breakfast voucher given for a nearby restaurant. The Pantai Inn website states parking is complementary for guests, so that should be edited. One other minor detail: room 323 could use some interior paint touch-ups. Overall, we would stay here again for the amazing location.",3

The room was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable and cosi with the great comforter. Access to all the restaurants were just a few step away, You made staying in La Jolla a very memorable one. We will be back.",5
Toni B,Impeccable,"Our family had a nice brief stay at Pantai Inn. There were many pluses, but a few minor minus’s. First, location location...the property sits directly across the street from the beach. That’s mostly what you are paying for. Location was my main reason for choosing this inn. My laws are older and I couldn’t have them walking up and down the hill to reach the other highly rated hotels. Downtown La Jolla and restaurants are just a short walk from the hotel, although we did climb a small hill. As mentioned before, my in laws are older so I used a delivery app to order food a few times and it was really easy. Parking was plentiful and that’s important, because who wants to look for parking at a busy beach? As for the hotel itself, from the outside, it’s a beautiful looking",1
Jill,Above and Beyond Hospitality,"This was another last minute trip to the coast to escape the heat and smoke here in Palm Springs. Only 2 hours from PS and we were in 76 degree weather and blue skies. The Pantai is a charming Balinese inspired boutique hotel at the water's edge. The staff run by Ryan, the general manager could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Ryan is amazing. He's everywhere and handles everything a guest could request. We've already reserved a room for next summer. That's how impressed we were!",4
Samiotisa,Flawless,My husband and I had the opportunity to travel to La Jolla from Louisiana on a Quarantined birthday get away and we loved the location and we also enjoyed our stay here at the Pantai inn. Ryan was truly a stand up guy ready to help at all times. Thank you for the great hospitality. I do feel that the place is dated but it didn’t detour us from savoring the experience. We pretty much felt as if we were back in our childhood visiting our grandparents home and that made it a memorable experience. I can’t see much updating to create this modern look for guest because it’s current theme has so much to offer. I do feel that the railings on balcony were bit of an eye sore and can use a bit of sanding and paint job because it created a distraction for me as looked at the views of the,4
buzzard51,Excellent staff,"Loved the location, beds are wonderful, and the grounds of the main building are tranquil and beautiful. I understand COVID is happening but there was no mention on the website that breakfast was no longer happening, I think there are many ways this service can still be accommodated. But we were offered the resort credit back to compensate. The rooms are somewhat clean, ours had lemon seeds on the counters. No regular coffee and our room was never serviced. I was told this needed to be requested but I would have no way of knowing that?? So our garbage sat, no clean towels etc. Just overall didn’t seem “COVID” clean. For the 5 star awards and reputation this was very far from that and for the cost I just don’t think it’s worth the money. I hate to leave bad reviews and I",1
jvjacob1,We love the overall service and location.,"Pantai Inn was our much needed, get away location. Ryan, GM, was helpful and welcoming upon our arrival. Check in was smooth. When we realized our in room keurig wasn't working, Lori, house keeping supervisor, promptly replaced it. She was also mindful of current covid restrictions. Louis, hotel supervisor, gave me a quick tour of the property and information on the most requested rooms. We stayed in an ocean view, king. Patio (balcony, if you are on 2nd or 3rd floor) overlooking the ocean, steps away from Shell Beach. The room was perfect size for my husband and myself. If I must find a flaw, the AC unit isn't the best. However, you are at the beach, open the door and let the ocean breeze cool the room. Taylor and Ryan were in the lobby as we checked out. Pleasant and",5
Jennifer K,La Jolla at its Best!!!,"Beautiful boutique property. Rented a two bedroom overlooking the ocean. Gorgeous view. Walk to Children's Beach. We Uber'd to La Jolla Shores beach. Tried the electric scooters. Sea lion and seal watching within walking distance as well as restaurants. Grocery store nearby. Giving a shout out to ""The Spot"", delicious food, and to Ryan, our host at Pantai Inn, whose above and beyond hospitality made our trip even better. 66 degrees in La Jolla, 116 degrees in Phoenix, didn't want to leave!",1

gblok847442,San Diego trip,"This was our 2nd stay and would give a 4.5 rating. We noticed the shower walls & floor needed some attention to address a minor amount of mildew during this stay - which was easily remedied. Another guest mentioned beds needing to be replaced - and we’d have to agree as certain rooms are in need more than others. The only other change noticed is the quality of the breakfast is now scaled back if compared to 4-5 years ago. Despite these items, we’d still give PanTai Inn a thumbs up - because their overall service would rate a 6,.... they go above and beyond most hotels and even compete with high end resorts. That said - regardless of the opportunities for improvement - we’ll be back.",1
Whitney R,Wedding Weekend Perfection,"Pantai Inn truly offered an unforgettable experience for my mother/son vacation. Everything was perfect from the location to the room amenities to the wonderful breakfast. Every employee we encountered showed great kindness and were a joy to interact with. The accommodations are perfect for families, couples, and those who just want to take in the best of La Jolla. Truly remarkable experience!!! PS- Stocked fridge was one of the many small touches that made this hotel in a league of its own :)",5
jimhessling,New mattress needed,"We kind of got off to a rough start in that I did not get the room I originally reserved. Though the SLH website indicated the room category was available, it actually was not. The person at the front desk assured me they were booking us into a very nice room. I understand this kind of thing happens, but it would be better to acknowledge the different room category in the confirmation email. That was the end of the negative experience. The room was indeed very nice. Spacious. Clean. Tastefully furnished. We found the Balinese theme very calming. The patio was spacious as well. The upholstery was worn and torn on one of the pieces. The bed was too soft for our tastes but still comfortable. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I can't recall the gentleman's name,",1
George F,Simply a Gem of a property,"The outside area is gorgeous. Fire pit, chairs with a view of the ocean, complimentary tea, water, coffee. Indoors is old and outdated, broken blinds. We called because our TV wasn't working. We got an answering machine at 8 pm and nobody ever called us back.",4

It was a joy to sip our wine on our own balcony and watch all the seaside activity of La Jolla. We, ended up staying here just by chance, as we had intended to go south to down town San Diego. We were taking a last minute walk on the beach and noticed how attractive the Inn was and decided to check it out. It was our good fortune to meet Albert who happily showed us around the Inn. It was love at first site. He quoted us a reasonable price and we signed up. The small reception area was elegantly appointed as was the court yard which overlooks the ocean. A delicious breakfast is included each day, along with unlimited soft drinks. Alcohol is available",1
billomo,Peaceful,The team was great but can only work with what they get. The toilet in the second bathroom did not flush properly. Efforts were made to fix it but we were only there for the weekend so could not be fixed during our stay. We had difficulty streaming on the television so the hotel provided a ROKU for our use. It worked well. These are minor issues but at this price we expected better. The location in La Jolla Cove is very good. Steps to restaurants and shops and nice pedestrian path.,5
Natalia K,Dare to stay in this hotel. You will never stay in another when traveling to La Jolla.,The staff at the Pantai Inn was amazing - the ocean front room we stay in was fabulous - the location of the Inn is perfect.

franklij,Fabulous resort,"This is the only hotel that we stay in when traveling to San Diego. We first stayed here in 2012 when it just opened. Now come almost every year. It is expensive, but provides great value because of the size of cottages/apartments and the kitchen. We travel with our 3 kids, and all fit comfortably. We also save on food because we cook in the kitchen. Cannot beat the location--you walk out of your room and you are right by the ocean. The luxury rooms are to die for. This is our home away from home.",4

We are always treated like VIP when we return to the Pan Tai for very personalized service from the gourmet breakfast, to designer coffee and teas throughout the day, then the knock on the door at 4pm for a chocolate fix. For real! There's more. We caught a few great workouts compliments of the Inn at the local club just a short walk away. The lighting at night is pure romance and sets the tone for a perfect couples get-away. We will return for our 3rd visit. Thank you to a top notch staff a wonderful stay.",5

I could not have asked for more gracious hosts who would do anything to ensure that we were happy with our experience. We loved everything except the breakfast as I would have prefered fresh, not packaged bagels and croissants since most of the breakfasts featured scrambled eggs and sausages. Even when the staff prepared baked items, they were not ready for at least an hour or two after breakfast opened. Small complaint for an overall wonderful experience.",1
Rachel S,Perfectly situated in the middle of La Jolla yet peaceful.,A wonderful hotel with all the creature features as you are used to at home.

Jill R,Wonderful!!,"We came to La Jolla after a 25 year absence. The Pantai Inn made our trip exceptional. It was easily one of the nicest places we've ever stayed. When they say right across the street from the ocean, they mean it. Plus it is withing easy walking distance of everything in La Jolla. The villa had a sitting area that looked directly onto the ocean, a living room, dining area, kitchen, and a separate bedroom. Oh, and I forgot the outside patio where one sunset we saw The Green Flash (look it up). The staff was great, starting with my call for a reservation, to the end, when I left my jacket after checking out. They took care of everything, from breakfast, served to 11 (we get up late) to having covers when you eat outside to keep the birds away from your food. Wonderful stay!",4
PeregianPair,Nothing is too much trouble at Pantai,"This was our second stay at the Pantai Inn, and we found it even better than it was 5 years ago. We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment on the front corner and it was so relaxing! We had 2 bedrooms, full kitchen, an incredible bathroom with rainhead shower, huge living room with a fireplace, an outside patio looking over the ocean, and a window-walled sunroom that also had a great ocean view if you wanted to be completely inside. We had a panoramic view of the Scripps Park/Pacific Ocean from our living room and it was just amazing. When we arrived, our refrigerator contained a plate of delicious assorted tiny delectable desserts decorated with orchids, along with cold canned beverages. (I'm not sure if everyone gets this or it was because of our anniversary). Everything was",4
hill3569,Never fails to impress!,"We definitely fall within the minority but similar to the other 3* reviews we only weigh it so high because the management went above and beyond to attempt everything possible to hope we enjoyed our stay.

The rooms themselves however were in need of upgrading more than the surface.",1

Our view from the front windows and front porch were of the ocean. The staff went the extra mile to make the stay special. Breakfast was included, as was cookies in the front office daily. They provided trays at breakfast for those who wanted to take breakfast back to their rooms. I could not have asked for a better hotel! We will definitely want to stay at this hotel again should we come back to La Jolla or San Diego.",1

The manager was so kind and helped me to reserve the same room we had last year, his friendly communication in a world of impatient people was so soothing. The front desk people were helpful and friendly and a problem with our TV was quickly addressed one evening.

Lori oversees the terrific housekeeping staff and they are all stars. Edwin",5
blondie229,great birthday gathering w/ friends,"The Pantai Inn is a gorgeous hotel with a great location in La Jolla, and an awesome staff. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a kitchen and fireplace, and a nice view of the ocean, which is just steps away. Everything is beautifully maintained.

MikeWB,"It's not the South Pacific but it is in La Jolla, so makes up for it","Staff was great, very courteous, helpful, pleasant. As far as location, you walk across the street to the beach. Room was awesome. Fresh fruit at breakfast was wonderful. First class all the way. Would love to stay again, except maybe for a week instead of just 2 days.",1

This place is a little gem!,5
Mark S,Best Boutique Lodging Experience in LaJolla,"Lovely inn and cottages in a wonderful place. Drawbacks: Tiki theme veers on cheesiness. Bathroom is absurd: no shelf space, no place to hang your towels (or anything else), water from rain shower covers the entire floor (because shower curtain too short,, so you have to use all your towels to step on). Because no bathroom shelfspace you have to use kitchen for your bathroom gear.",3
tamandmikewedding,Superior Service,"We stayed here one night while touring La Jolla and really enjoyed the grounds, location and the friendly staff. The hotel appears to be a collection of older apartment buildings that have been melded together using a Balinese theme. The thin walls and windows of our room allowed sound to easily pass through and it felt a bit like staying in an RV. We easily heard neighboring guests arrive and talking. However, breakfast was terrific and included, plus free parking and snacks. This dichotomy makes it harder to rate as it depends on what you value more. Overall, the Pantai Inn is a very good choice for staying in La Jolla. If we return, we might try staying in one of the brick buildings facing the ocean.",1
Safari713311,Enchanting place with A+ location,"The staff was very helpful and attentive. Very nice location. Really enjoyed having the kitchen and the separate living room area.

Peter R,A precious little gem in Southern California,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights in one of the Ocean View King rooms. Great location (right across the beach and withing walking distance from La Jolla shopping and dining) and very personal service during check-in and throughout our stay. The front desk staff was warm and welcoming and went above and beyond anything I have ever experienced in my travels. Yes the rooms are slightly dated and could use a little TLC here and there but did I mention the LOCATION and SERVICE? The Breakfast experience is well above average, not so much in the overall variety of what's been offered but the quality of items. It could probably benefit from some more variety at that price point. Regardless, we'll be back for sure!",4
Janet S,Pitch Perfect,Quick and easy check in process but well trained front desk staff. Great that they had an excellent wine selection in the room for me. It’s great that you’re right on the ocean and can hear the waves at night. Great breakfast included. Close to shopping and many great restaurants for lunch and dinner as well. Will plan to come back soon. Great place for wedding parties or family reunion as all rooms are near each other.,1

The trip was fabulous, we saw lovely places, ate well and, of course, spent time with our son. Apart from the ""seeing son"" bit, one thing did stand out and that was the Pantai Inn, its rooms and its team. From the moment we met Albert in the evening to arrange our stay, things got better and better. Next morning we arrived at the small reception entrance to be greeted by a fabulous smile from the handsome face of Ryan, the GM. He was welcoming as if we were long lost friends who had just arrived. Mike, the director was on the case for any little whim we had. The reception team of Angelica & Derby, warm, lovely & attentive.

Our first impressions were very good after our drive down from LA a nice young man checked us in & showed us our room. The reception area is very nice, has a pleasant seating area & coffee, cold drinks etc. We had a cottage at the back of the property facing onto a residential street, in retrospect I would have booked one facing the ocean as even though we had seats and a small table sitting outside wouldn't really have been a pleasant option. The cottage itself was nice enough, but for the price we paid (around £300 per night) I'd have expected better furniture in the living room & nicer bathrooms, which were of similar quality to those in a 2 or 3 star hotel. That said, where the Pantai Inn",1

The hotel was gorgeous and so peaceful with water running over rocks and plants everywhere! The staff was so accommodating with everything and set us up each night with treats and surprises!,1
TONY C,Shangrila,Just got back from a quick 2 day visit to La Jolla and our 3rd stay at the Pantai Inn.

They’re more than willing to help with restaurant reservations and recommendations, they remembered our group and which room we were in, and they just made us feel so welcome at every encounter. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is beautifully landscaped and is situated perfectly between the beachfront and the shops/restaurants. And the breakfast is top notch! Wish we could have stayed a whole week. Highly recommend!",5
jjitsell,Incredible service and hospitality by Ryan!,Our group was very impressed with the beautiful hotel and especially the accommodating staff! The Balinese decor had such a Zen feel you couldn’t help but feel relaxed. Our room felt spacious and clean (although the bathroom could have used a little updating) and we appreciated the complimentary snacks and beverages available. At breakfast we almost had to pull ourselves away to stop eating as the in-house chef provided a delicious selection every day. The property is by the beach and the nearby shops and restaurants are just a flight of stairs away through Ocean Lane. A big thank you to Ryan and the rest of the hotel staff. We will definitely return!,3

I would return in a heartbeat. Oh, and, you can't find a better spot to view the sunset than the Pantai Inn!",5
Reed502,Great Stay,"Great find in La Jolla. We enjoyed the sunset over the Pacific from our deck. Location can’t be beat, nice walks right in front, easy walk to the restaurant area. Very convenient drive to San Diego attractions. The staff was great - thank you, Chelsea, for fixing my iPhone and saving my vacation!! Nice breakfasts every day, room was spacious, comfy and clean. Only real complaints relate to the bathroom and storage. There are no shelves and hooks in the bath for personal stuff or for preserving towels for future use. The shower is pretty, but the water splashes all over the bath floor, so you can’t leave your stuff on the floor, not that you’d want to. Even still, I highly recommend Pantai, and would stay again when I’m in the area.",1

We booked a suite, but upon arrival were upgraded to a cottage facing the shoreline at no charge. The grounds are beautiful, well-preserved, and feature Bali-inspired fountains and ornamentals. Plenty of design details, both on the grounds, and within each unit. From huge murals in the breakfast area, to exquisite tile work everywhere, there's much to see and enjoy. Our cottage was large, with a beautiful kitchen, two nicely sized bedrooms, each with modern TVs. The buffet breakfast changes daily, with a full selection of hot foods. Seating is indoor or outdoor overlooking the ocean. Service is second to none. Mike the manager quickly worked to solve our small internet connection issue.",1

It’s such an amazing boutique hotel with many complimentary services including amazing breakfast, free non-alcoholic drinks, coffee and tea all day, homemade sweets each afternoon, and much more. The best part is their attention to detail to make sure you have the best experience. Staff go out of their way to help you and are super friendly. We were celebrating a milestone birthday. The staff heard of gluten-free request that I had made early in our stay. They surprised us with a tray of gluten free desserts brought to our hotel room that afternoon.

Of course Mike picked up the phone. His kindness and caring came out as we spoke. I told Mike everything I was hoping for and he more than delivered..When I arrived at Pantai after a long day of travel, there was Mike....and cookies. I requested a spectacular Ocean view..I'm always let down when I get to a hotel that promises a view, but not at Pantai.. In room 323, you are basically on top of the Ocean seen through huge windows and on your balcony. The room was beautiful.

BUT you have a big kitchen... which I don't use... After talking about that with the team .. they send someone ""to fix it"" - which actually opened ONE window.. BTW the windows are not easy to open and require a tool after insisting I got the option to ""CHECK OUT"" at 12 and again ""CHECK IN"" in 15..which was extremely inconvenient... no body offered a compensation...

Delicious breakfast every morning. And Mike the manager is incredible, like the energizer bunny, always ready to fill your requests immediately, greeted us like old friends. He should get a raise!!! The only caveats on sleep quality and the room are the bed was too soft for us and the bathroom in the studio is tiny. Those minor drawbacks would never keep us from returning.

The rooms are beautiful—some of the most beautiful we’ve ever stayed in, with views of the La Jolla beaches & ocean. You can enjoy the view from the quiet of your balcony or their lovely courtyard. It’s the perfect way to enjoy the action in a peaceful setting.

We loved the space of the cottage. The living room with large screen tv, couch and chairs was a comfortable room to relax in. The kitchen area with counter space and refrigerator, chairs and table along with a complimentary bags of snacks and non-alcoholic beverages was perfect. The bedroom and bathroom was spacious and comfortable. While a few of the cottages like ours were set back on the property and required a circuitous walk to the breakfast room, it was not too taxing.

People: Mike, Chelsea, Alain, Rachel, Joseph & to all the people always with a smile & can do attitude ensuring the guests are welcomed, needs addressed and everything humming along beautifully. Staff are professional and warm, striking just the right balance. a. Mike the GM – top notch GM and we know many given our many stays globally. His leadership certainly has much to do with the experience at the Pantai. Thank you Mike! I couldn’t imagine Pantai Inn without you and the fabulous team you have assembled.

randnleach,Amazing!!!,"My wife and I were treated royally from the moment of our arrival- we had some special treats in our room for the occasion of our anniversary!! The views of the ocean wer grand!! The comfort of the bed was unreal. The helpfulness and willingness of the staff to go ""beyond"" was so grand. The sunsets were breathtaking- and we didn't have to travel very far to take them in- just to our balcony. The breakfasts were extremely tasty",1
Connector792733,Top Notch,You can’t beat the views. Not to mention that restaurants and shops and even art galleries are just around the corner from the place. Staff was outstanding and could not have been better. The rooms could do with a bit of updating but the view and staff help even things out. I will go back for sure.,5
msu_gal,Perfect Stay at the Pantai Inn,We loved this place! Great for a group trip! The service was incredible and helped us in providing beach equipment to enjoy our stay. The breakfast was incredible. This was not your average continental breakfast. It was restaurant quality amazing food with a great variety of options. They also offered to make you speciality items. The rooms were lovely and spacious. The staff was welcoming and attentive. Thank you for a great experience! Can’t wait to return,3
MargieZMazurek,Great location,Pantai Inn is lovely. There is a reason for the great Trip Advisor Traveler Rating! We (Husband and I) returned from a 4 night romantic getaway (anniversary) over Labor Day Holiday. The extraordinary guest service begin as soon as we picked up the phone to call from our home in Arizona to come to La Jolla. The person who we spoke on the phone was wonderful – working hard to get us what we wanted in a high season short time – frame. We really “needed” a King bed… and she worked hard to make that happen. We had a really special “Partial Ocean View” one bedroom (Room 203) with a four poster King Bed. Lovely bedding twice daily housekeeping – kitchen with small refrigerator - huge balcony where we took our breakfast (included) and ate each morning there. (Next time may,1

Fearless410897,Awesome spot in La Jolla Cove!,"We've stayed at Pantai Inn a number of times and the property never disappoints. Great staff, a wonderful breakfast every morning, and lots of little touches (my wife loved the tiny tray of desserts that the inn supplied for our first night). We arrived about an hour before check-in time and just wanted to park, but it turned out our room was ready so they showed us right over.",1
julieph57,Pantai Inn needs some TLC,"Had such a wonderful stay at the Pantai Inn in August. First of all we had a death in the family and had to reschedule our stay (which was non-refundable) and they were great and very understanding. We had a 1 bedroom cottage and it was so nice to have the additional space to be able to put the kids to bed in the bedroom and still be up for a few hours. The service here is amazing, like nothing I have experienced at a hotel. Every staff person is always interested in making sure you have everything you need. We had 2 wild kiddos with us and they were so patient with getting us the highchair for breakfast each morning. There are beers in your fridge that are included. There are chocolates on your bed at night. I loved every minute here.",4
Iloveringo,"I really wanted to like it, but I didn't","Chose an ocean view room which was very nice with separate living room/kitchenette, super comfortable bed and bedding. Didn't realize balcony wraps around building and connects to adjoining room's balcony. Not a big deal as you're facing different directions, but the gate that separates the balconies doesn't have a latch, which meant we did not sleep with the door open at night. Room was showing its age a bit (bathroom floor is in need of a deep clean, mismatched touch up paint finishes), but overall the property is immaculately maintained, beautiful, and comfortable, particularly the public spaces (lobby and courtyard). Complimentary breakfast was decent and complimentary snacks, tea, coffee, and waters were very convenient. Great location, beautifully kept grounds, excellent",4
mbtravelMaryland,Amazing Boutique Inn with the best location in La Jolla! A must stay!!,This place is completely unassuming from the street and has a very low online presence for a reason...it is a well-kept secret that travelers want to keep hidden from the masses! Perfect for a romantic getaway and a weekend to feel genuinely welcomed by the over-the-top accommodating staff. We will certainly be back and look forward to making more memories at this special spot.,1
Steven S,Weekend getaway,"Pantai Inn gets the highest rating for exceptional service. We love the quaint feel of the Inn, and the room is comfortable and well maintained. The staff is truly superb. We enjoyed our stay greatly and hope to return next year.",5
Lorena R,GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!,"Like most of the reviews, I agree that the strength of this hotel is its manager (Mike), staff (Chelsea and Jetta) and location. The hotel needs updating/remodeling. The lodging costs were not commensurate with our room's dated decor, bathroom and furniture. I urge the owners of this establishment to be grateful for their wonderful team of employees and work to revitalize this Pan-tired Inn.",1
Richard H,Did not want to check out - did want to stay longer.,"I stayed at Pantai Inn with my family for two nights. I had decided to book it because it has great reviews on Tripadvisor and I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately I did not. I must say that the location is perfect and the staff are some of the most kind and helpful I have ever met, but the room was a massive let down. It is in serious need of a total refurbishment, way too old and smelly despite all the effort to cover it up. Also not happy about the cleaning standard, I found black hairs in the shower the minute I walked in the bathroom. As I said I really wanted to like it because the people working at Pantai Inn are truly special, but I would definitely not stay there again nor recommend anyone to do it (unless you really do not care about the state of the room you",5
Ruthie D,Outstanding Experience,"The accommodations and staff at Pantai exceeded our expectations and rivals that of Four Seasons, Pendry, and Belmond in my opinion. Two bedroom suite on second floor was spacious with windows in every room lending amazing ocean views. Would recommend opening the windows at night to hear the sound of the ocean and the trickling waterfall which landscapes this amazing boutique inn. Additionally, loved the comfort of the bed and linens! Whereas small by comparison, the bathroom was functional with a great rainfall shower. Bathroom lighting was good with nice toiletries. I think a stay in LaJolla would be an incomplete in any accommodations other than Pantai Inn. A special thanks to the manager Mike and staff for elevating our experience. Can’t wait to return.",3
Seychelles7,Beautiful Property - Gracious Staff,My wife and flew down from Nor Cal on Thursday and stayed three nights. We stayed in one of the cottages that had a very large deck with a great view of the ocean and a large grassy area that was a hot spot for many people to enjoy. The location is fantastic. The place its self could use a little updating.,1

katwomanrider,Best service ever!,We booked a 2 bedroom cottage for a girls trip weekend and while I shared the location with my group no one checked out the place before we arrived. When we got to the location they were surprised and happy with our weekend accommodations. Every one of the staff members that we interacted with us treated us like VIP's we loved our experience staying at the Pantai Inn.,4
Expedition552977,Impeccably professional and gracious staff,"I live in San Diego, so I’m a little bit of a “hotel snob” when choosing to book a hotel in my city. I have seen this hotel for a while now on Trip Advisor and was curious to give it a try because of its #1 rating. It did not disappoint! It was my birthday weekend and they went above and beyond in their service to make our stay extra special. I didn’t want to leave! We had an ocean-front 2 bedroom suite and it was AMAZING. Breathtaking views, yummy breakfast that was included, and perfect location for walking to restaurants. We definitely will be back! Thank you Pantai Inn for making our stay so special.",1
YuxuanXING,Review,I have been coming here for years this place cannot get any better which I was told it was sold PLEASE!!! I really really hope that they leave things the way they are. Because if not it may be devastating to them. I work at the Wynn/Encore in Las Vegas and been there since day 1. I know details when I see it and the Pantai is absolutely one of them. Mike Murell who’ve known for many years now is the backbone of this place. I’ve followed him every since he left the Glorietta Bay in Coronado. He knows how to pick his staff.Obviously they love it there because they’re still there. My first day at the Wynn/Encore.Steve Wynn had a meeting with all his employees and just wanted us to know that we come first because without good employees we won’t be able to bring in great guest.,5
mbaker1482,All around perfect,"Allen checked us in and made sure we were completely taken care of. They offered complimentary snacks and honored or birthday with a chef made dessert. The beach was across the street from our room. Honestly, after a 6 day trip, this stay is the only one I can think of. Our only regret is that I wish we could have stayed longer.",1
Copperbench,Awesome,Thank you to Pantai Inn for making a surprise birthday weekend for my husband so amazing. The staff is extraordinary and I'm curious if there are any requests that they cannot fulfill. Location was the best it could have been with such beautiful views. We hope to return within the next few years.,5
kkehn,Perfect choice,"I've stayed at various hotels on La Jolla Cove over the last 24 years ~ this was my favorite hotel stay. It was the staff who made the difference. They each consistently displayed a genuinely joyful and natural welcoming. Their customer service during our transactions (online correspondence, phone & in-person) and during each part of our stay emulated wishing us to truly enjoy our time. And the wonderful extra touches they added to our room really personalized our stay. Also, the quality of the bed and sheets were the most comfortable we've ever experienced. The military discount was the icing. These elements are much more important to us than the view (which was of course perfect!). Thank you ""Mike and your staff"" for a wonderful stay!",3

ldesoyza,Awesome Experience!,"This will be our go-to place from now on. We could not have been happier. The Pantai Inn is located perfectly for walks along the shore, walking into town for shopping or dining, sea lions and sunsets. Breakfast was different each day, always good, and never rushed or crowded. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had one of the rooms with 3br, 2ba, kitchen, dining, and living room. It was great for our family of 6. The private deck had an ocean view. One of the best things was the private driveway for two cars. Our son, who lives in San Diego, came up and had a parking spot waiting for him. It can be very difficult to find parking in and around San Diego and La Jolla. The driveway was priceless. We will definitely stay here again when traveling to the area. Thanks Mike,",4

Venture590370,Perfect Weekend,"I have been to La Jolla before, but finding out about Pantai Inn was perfect. My girlfriend and I loved it! I was such an amazing place to stay. Right across from the water, beautiful property, the most friendly and helpful staff, delicious complimentary breakfast, a cozy firepit, great views and cool and unique rooms (we stayed in a private cottage on the property - highly recommend!) - it is the perfect place for a couple! What was really nice was it didn't feel resorty at all - it was too quaint to be like that - and everything was so personal and accommodating-you felt like you were the only people there. We honestly cannot imagine staying anywhere else the next time we visit the area. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not to stay here when you",3

Paul-JamieRamos R,Beautiful view and wonderful get away,"Beautiful view and great location. A bit noisy from the street traffic but it's worth it. Staff was very welcoming and attentive - especially Mike. I would choose third floor southside with ocean view balcony next time to have more distance from the street. But either way, I highly recommend it!",1
Sharon D,3 Generations,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our visit in La Jolla and our stay at Pantai Inn! We highly recommend! We had a king room on the 3rd floor with an ocean view balcony. What more could you ask for? The Inn greets you with a plate full of goodies and cold beverages in your room’s refrigerator. They have fresh cookies daily and drinks available in the lobby whenever needed. The breakfast was delicious and the location perfect. Only tiny issue we had was that it was the smallest bathroom we’ve ever had; honestly quite claustrophobic for me. But as long as you have no secrets with your roomie and can leave the door open, no major problem. But with all of the rooms available, I’m sure other rooms have different options. But lovely Inn and would definitely recommend if you’re heading to",5

They also have complimentary soft drinks, water and Pellegrino along with a yummy breakfast each morning. The location is THE BOMB! You literally walk across the street and are at La Jolla Cove.

Ccarroll24,Trip to La Jolla,"The Pantai Inn is a small property (30 rooms) occupying several buildings, ideally located across the street from the ever-changing ocean. It's old but well maintained, and the ambience is homelike. The stretch of coast directly opposite affords absorbing wildlife watching, and there are pocket-sized swimming beaches within a few hundred yards. The Balinese décor is authentic. Our suite was nicely furnished, down to the inclusion of Echo Dot (Alexa smart speaker) devices in both rooms. The bathroom is very small but we found it serviceable for a stay of five nights. Mike, Chelsea, and their colleagues provided attentive, friendly service. The complimentary breakfast is very well prepared by Javier, but the selection is limited.

In all fairness, the hotel was beautiful and the professionalism and attentiveness of the management is what compelled me to post a follow up. Although we had a few issues as outlined in my earlier review, Mr. Murrell went out his way to understand what our concerns were and to address them in the most expeditious manner possible. To his and the inn's credit, they are continually striving to ensure the best possible experience of the guest; especially when unexpected issues may crop up. I applaud their level of commitment, as it is becoming more of a rarity in today's hospitality community.

Roving67797280401,June 2019,"Excellent property - right at La Jolla cove We had a unique opportunity to enjoy one of the best apartments with a full ocean view This is a traditional hotel - so you have to accept that experience may be different than in a top network hotel. Every apartment is different, buildings are traditional bungalows - which means that they can be a little bit accustic, there is only one relatively small bathroom. But in return you get excellent location, attentive staff and very unique San Diego experience",1

I live in Las Vegas and we have the most amazing hotels with the highest levels of Customer Service but this by far has exceeded my expectations. Everyone and I mean everyone from the phone to rooms cleaning were astounding and friendly. The breakfasts Were excellent and include it. It was our anniversary and they made it an exceptionally special event. I would come back here anytime I go to San Diego. It was extremely close to all the shopping districts and the oceanfront views were beautiful. Thank you so much for making this a memorable anniversary trip.

OnAir46248692945,Weekend break,"We rented unit 108, a premium ocean view room. Room was musty smelling along with being able to hear all noises from guests in unit above Housekeeping forgot a bottle of Windex in room and forgot to replace kitchen trash can with new liner.. Staff was friendly, but could not compensate for an inferior accommodation. We will stay in another hotel next time we are in La Jolla.",1

PerpetualMotion19,Everything was perfect,"I can not say enough...I was having a hard time finding what I was looking for in a place to accomodate my wife, and myself for our Anniversary. We are usually a little hard to please I am sorry to say. Somehow I ran into the Pantai Inn and read the reviews (to myself I said no way). Chelsea picked up the phone and created magic. Voila after spending a short 40 minutes with me. Yes 40 minutes on the phone giving me all the details I could possibly want. I BOOKED. For me that does not happen I always have to investigate, speaking with her put me at ease. It was just so easy and too simple to pass up. By the way the Inn had only 1 room left, and I am still wondering how it is that I was able to get in. Well needless to say our stay was just short of a fantasy ! Meaning it",3

Big breakfast every morning - Javier especially friendly and helpful - not to take away from anyone else though. Everyone was great! Parking was a huge bonus! The view from our room was perfect. Open the door in the morning and hear the waves crashing. We go to San Diego at least twice a year to visit family and we will definitely stay here again. We hated to leave.

Rachel S,Beach Paradise,"Great location in downtown La Jolla - can walk to all the restaurants and shops and the cove is almost right across the street. One caveat - you can't walk from here to the beach (ie: La Jolla Shores). The room was huge, with a kitchen, dining area, living room, bedroom and bathroom. The king bed was really comfortable - better than my bed at home. The complimentary snacks and water were much appreciated, and the breakfast was great!

The customer service was exceptional. We were texted by Mike and Carlos before arrival to see if we needed anything. Carlos did a wonderful job showing us around the hotel. The breakfast chef, unfortunately, I didn't catch his name, was super friendly and accommodating. A delicious free breakfast is included. The housekeeping staff was impeccable. Dalia and Claudia did an amazing job on our room. The room was super clean. They even wiped down the remote every day. This was the best housekeeping I have had at any hotel.

The individual unit/room set up on property is unique and works harmoniously within the site giving the stay a sense of contained adventure.",5
hipposrock,The ABSOLUTE Best!!,"This was our 4th stay and for us the Pantai Inn is excellent. We hear the waves at night, we swim in LaJolla cove which is a 5 minute walk, we boogie board at nearby beaches, we walk to restaurants and shops and also explore the area on foot and by car. The manager, Mike, is attentive to our needs as is his friendly and capable staff. The breakfast buffet is nutritious and fresh and can be taken on the patio facing the ocean. We like the small kitchen in case we want to eat in our room occasionally. The property is full of small waterfalls, tropical flowers. And.... did I mention the Inn is right on the Pacific ocean!",3

vbjoe,Unique and wonderful,We had an amazing stay at this hidden gem right across from the ocean in La Jolla where we celebrated our anniversary. The personalized care from the most-attentive staff was beyond compare. The general Manager was there to greet us upon arrival and say good-bye and thank you upon departure. All the staff we encountered exceeded our expectations as well. The humongous double shower was incredible and the unique spa tub with the gorgeous mural was just one of the ways this Inn made us feel we were actually in Bali and at peace with the world. We couldn't have asked for anything more from the scrumptious chocolate-covered strawberries we received upon check-in to the delicious variety of offerings for breakfast. The location is perfect! We could hear the ocean waves and,4
James N,Great stay. Thank you!,"If you’re looking for a relaxed beautiful getaway, this is the place. Frankly, I’d live here if I could. Our room 204 was an upstairs room with an “ocean peek” when sitting on the living room couch. There is a separate bedroom, dining room, and kitchenette. The fireplace ignites with a flick of a switch. The room was immaculate and comes with free snacks. The breakfast that’s included is excellent. Most importantly, the service was so accommodating and everyone so cheerful. What a wonderful place!",4

Dr Z,Simply amazing,This place is unique. Great staff and service (even a mother’s day gift for my wife). They texted my repeatedly asking if we needed anything. You could not be closer to the ocean if you tried. Outdoor seating for breakfast with an ocean view was amazing. Great bed and comfort in the room. If you want a one of a kind place right on the ocean with great service this is it. Small facility. Close to the village and the sea lions. We would stay again.,1

We loved walking to the amazing coastal walkway trail and seeing the seals, walking over to the caves or playing on the grassy area every day. We also loved being able to walk to the shops and restaurants in the village. We booked a 2-bedroom classic view cottage and it was so nice of the staff to stock the kitchen with snacks and drinks everyday. Our cottage was fine, but I took a tour of one of the three-bedroom partial ocean view cottages and would definitely book that next time-- worth the extra price because of the updated rooms, balcony, and large dining table, which would have been nice with our kids.

The included breakfasts were just ok, the room was nice enough, but it was the staff that made the long weekend fantastic. They climbed stairs and did things for us that I have never seen elsewhere. We got rides to nearby places without asking. When we asked what time we needed to check out, the employee ay the desk came on his own to our room after figuring out that we could relax and then change clothes for the late day wedding in a room that was unoccupied because they were repairing an air conditioner, Whoever interviews job applicants at this place really has fantastic taste, as every employee was this attentive and cheerful.

It is indeed a small luxury hotel of the world and I stayed in many of this group, this tops all. Do not expect too much from the breakfast buffet, it is limited , but all you need from my pov , and of course in order to have everything fresh you need to limit choices, we missed nothing, in opposite the fresh products were absolutely great. Coffee in the afternoon is coming with home made cookies , very tasteful. The location is great , in the center of everything and only a minute to see the seals. One recommendation go for an ocean view room , you will love it. We will certainly return, we stayed 2 nights but it was like 2 weeks holidays. Thank you Pantai Inn !!",5

With the door to the balcony open, the ocean waves sounded like they were crashing directly below us.The view is better from the second or third floor. However, there is no elevator, but the staff is very helpful with your luggage.The bathroom was very small, as is likely the case with all oceanfront properties in this area. Not a problem for us, but this is something to be considered by prospective guests. A wonderful location close to La Jolla cove and easy walking distance to the restaurants and shopping in town. Ample parking at the hotel, if a bit cramped.",5

They are humble and are genuinely real about their heart to serve. We got to them by name Mike, Mark, Candy, Jessica to name a few. The breakfast was outstanding and the place is just quaintly charming. It is not fancy but the amenities and the extras and the small things matter. Like I stated above it’s simply Awesomely real and we can’t wait to go back. One more thing to note... we asked if there were any other hotels like this in the area. They said yes and introduced us to the idea of the Santa Barbara properties. We were treated so well that if the others accept BizX as well, we will visit them all. We were that impressed!!! Okay I’m",4
Sam R,Amazing location. Excellent service.,From the great service to the beautiful views this place was absolutely amazing!! Thanks Chelsea and the rest of the staff for making my family’s trip very memorable! My family and I will definitely be back,1
Compass60122154601,Great Stay,"I expect most of the The Pantai Inn rooms have terrific views; even the partial view 3 bedroom had a decent view of the water if over a parking lot and between two close buildings. The unit's space (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, full well stocked kitchen, living room, dining room table) is wonderful, especially for a family. The location (a short walk from a waterfront park and a short walk from the excellent shops and restaurants of La Jolla) is really fantastic. The price is also very good for the number of bedrooms and living space. My criticisms of the space are: the clear glass dining room table was close to the deck window and several of us bumped into the pointy edge; the living room couches were not that comfortable; and the bathrooms could use updating (sink and tub were old",5
Feet5,Superb Location,"Great location, great room and great staff! Have stayed several times in La Jolla but this was the BEST! And, was great that Pantai has courtesy car to to/from dinner. Nice breakfast with great outdoor seating option. Thanks!",1
Petro007,Great Stay in La Jolla,"WOW!!!!! I don't know where to begin...my husband grew up in the LaJolla area but this was our first stay in LaJolla village. Choice Pantai Inn based on other Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed. We had an ocean view suite that had a view up and down the coast. Sunsets out our door were incredible. From the minute we checked in to our departure the staff was the best we have ever met. The attention to detail was off the charts!!!! The location in the center of the village made our stay convenient to everything. Except for a trip to the zoo we never left the area. There is a resort fee but the Inn provided breakfast, parking, passes to a local gym, snacks, soft drinks and water. Well worth the money. My only disappointment which I did pass on to the GM is the",5
Frazier_13,Earns #1 Ranking,"Mike at the desk texted us that they were looking forward to our arrival and that if we needed anything to feel free to contact him. We were greeted by name, there were fresh cookies and drinks/snacks available in the lobbby and in our room. Parking was included. We booked an ocean front room - were on the third floor with a balcony. Room was spacious. Bed comfy. Bathroom was small but well appointed. Breakfast was great - eggs, sausage, vege hash, zucchini bread. Granola. Toast. Juice. Coffee. Offered to make us an omelette, pancakes or French toast. Walking along the coast was enchanting- seals, sea lions and sea birds. Close to restaurants. Amazingly well kept property with beautiful touches - statuary, fountains and beautiful plants everywhere. We loved our stay and will be",3
SLeonard1,Excellent stay,"This was our second stay at the Pantai Inn and it was as expected if not better! What a lovely boutique hotel...and the staff could not be nicer! Love the breakfast, turn down service and parking! Many extras!",1
run4trails,Spring break in San Diego,"Highly recommend if you like the ""small"" feel with great perks. Even though it was rainy during our stay we loved being right across the street from the ocean. Being able to walk on the coastal trail and to great restaurants made it a great reason to return alone. The breakfast every morning was delicious and not the ""just the usual fare."" The staff was very friendly.",5
claudine88,Wlnderful service!,"Great stay at Pantai Inn in Lo Jolla! A beautiful and well maintained property in a great location, along with a great staff. Will definitely look to stay here again in the future when in the San Diego area.",1
Jill D,Amazing Honeymoon,"Chose the Pantai Inn based on the TripAdvisor rating and it lived up to its #1 ranking. We strongly considered another nearby, more expensive hotel and were glad we stayed at the Pantai Inn. Clean, comfortable, excellent service and location. A good value too with parking, non alcoholic beverages and a different breakfast each day.",4
Culture03353428908,East to West Coast,"First class inn. Many amenities, staff very helpful, many complementary services including swift laundry. Charming. Sent a review to Trip Advisor. We enjoyed the location, on Coast Blvd. Parking avalilable at no addional cost.",4
SP12350,One of the best hotels!,Perfect location for walking along coastline and walking to town for shopping and dinner. Very nice breakfast! They even made gluten free toast and waffles for me. Staff was very helpful and friendly!,1
sha99lom,Rejuvenating stay at Pantai Inn,"My first reason to book this hotel was its location! What a pleasure to hear the sound of the sea from your rooms, and so close to everything in La Jolla that a car is really not needed! But what impressed me the most is the staff: everybody was so pleasant, eager to help. Our stay in La Jolla was really pleasurable thanks to Pantai Inn and its staff!",5
RANLakewood,Perfect,"Got packed up and Sat am on our way to Pantai Inn with a text Welcome message! They asked about an ETA of our arrival, rolled in around 1pm- Room was already waiting for us! Beautiful views from our balconies- Huge Jacuzzi tub in Master bath- lots of linens! 4 poster COMFY bed too. They recommended Brockton Cottages for dinner 7pm reservation- YUM!! Returned from dinner & was completely BLOWN away by the candles, bottle of Champagne & chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals on the floor and around the tub. Woke up and had a delicious breakfast on the patio! Walked to the sea lion beach & shopped along the way back to the Inn. This was a gift from my brother for our Honeymoon! All I could say was, ""WOW, top notch!"" The staff was very friendly and polite.",1
GoPlaces36906973389,Overrated,"Wonderful Inn! Truly exceeded our expectations. Accommodations and service were top notch. Fantastic ocean views, wonderful suite with fireplace, delicious complimentary breakfast available each morning.Already planning our next trip!",5
Tourist285615,A Fabulous Find in La Jolla!,"I would encourage anyone looking for a place to stay in La Jolla to consider the Pantai Inn. Beautiful property and only steps from the water. The photos online don't do the property justice! Our room was comfortable, the staff was so helpful, and it was very convenient to everything in La Jolla. 5 stars! :)",3
MsMacSF,"Great location, but not a stellar hotel","We had a remarkable experience staying at the Pantai Inn. From making the reservation with Chelsea, to the personal welcome upon arrival, Pantai Inn surpasses all expectations. I loved the refrigerator full of free water and soft drinks, the snacks and chocolate that arrives as part of turn down service. Most beautiful, however, were the sunsets over the ocean, perfectly visualized from our windows. All in all, this is a fantastic place to stay in La Jolla!",1
ChooChoo34,Charming getaway,We were there for a weekend prior to a conference in downtown. Wonderful property. Perfect location. Exceptional service. Delicious and healthy breakfast included. Good price point. We would not hesitate to return.,5
Manfers,"Beautiful property, location and top notch customer service!","We were seduced by the excellent rating of this hotel. However, the feel is more of a bed & breakfast. The reception area was very pleasant as were all the staff. However, the wedding suite (room 112) was very dated, the wi-fi was very frustrating to work and the breakfast was surprisingly poor for for such a highly rated and expensive hotel.",1
186dwainw,Lovely hotel!,Our family of 4 had a great stay at the Pantaii Inn! We loved the spacious accommodations and perfect location! The staff was also super helpful and the included breakfast was delicious! Don't forget to try the homemade cookies in the afternoon! We can't wait to return!,4
Dante A,A hidden jewel,"We wanted to love it. We booked an ocean view room and that was absolutely the right choice. The views from our front porch were spectacular. The hotel has some nice features, including a fire pit and a lovely patio with a fountain where you can eat breakfast. The cookies and chocolate for turn down were nice touches. Breakfast included fresh fruit and daily specialty items, but wasn’t exceptional. We found the room to be only a notch above a good motel. However, it was really a suite with a kitchen and living room, which we loved. The fixtures, flooring, bedding, and furniture are unexceptional and verging on funky. While parking is “included”, you will pay a fee for amenities. For what we paid, I don’t think we would choose this spot again but, given the views and location,",4
Michelle B,Family trip,"We got a room here on short notice. The nicest staff ever, there was a birthday surprise waiting for my wife when we got in the room, I think mentioned it was her birthday but I didn't make a deal about it and they remembered! Our kids also loved everything about the place. The location is amazing, right on the coast with a beautiful coastal path and everything you need nearby. Mike was the manager when we arrived and he went out of his way to make our stay memorable, thanks Mike!",1
Christoffer Braathen,"Nice hotel, great location, medium food and dated rooms","Just spent our 5th Spring Break at the Pantai and, as always, we had a great time. Most rooms are larger than a typical hotel, include very practical in room kitchen amenities and have beautiful partial/full ocean views. The daily breakfast is good and the cookies that are available in the lobby every afternoon are to die for! Every member of the Pantai staff goes out of their way to provide excellent customer service. The beautiful location in the La Jolla Cove is perfect for cliff side walks along the ocean and viewing wildlife (seals, sea lions, pelicans, dolphins and sea creatures.) Wonderful restaurants are within walking distance to the hotel. If you don’t want to walk, the Pantai provides car service within a 5 mile radius. Piazza 1909, Isola, Duke’s, Prepkitchen and",5
Freedom29386901568,WOW !!,"My daughter and I stayed here to celebrate her 15th birthday. Everything was perfect. The bed was super comfy, breakfast was yummy, the room had an amazing view and we spent lots of time on the cove. We will be back!!!",1
Lee F,Weeklong Retreat,"The Pantai Inn was a delightful experience. The staff were very helpful, friendly and informative about their Inn and surrounding restaurants. They offer a car service for complimentary dinner to and from restaurants. It was a chilly evening and Chelsea had the heaters on in the backseats for us when she picked us up. They placed a complimentary sweets tray and streamers in our room for our arrival for my husband’s birthday. We had the perfect room with the best view as Chelsea took the time to describe the rooms to me and different available dates. Many of the rooms are on the second floor by stairs. We did not ask for baggage assistance but I might recommend that for seniors. Snacks in the room were complimentary and offered generously each day along with a lovely",5
Scenic20758668294,Mom & Son Vacay,We have stayed in La Jolla several times and this was by far one of the best places. The staff was awesome and Mike took care of everything we needed. The views of the ocean were awesome and the complimentary breakfast was great. We will definitely be back!,3
Ann P,Best customer service,"This small hotel offers decent value for money, has a great location and view, but the rooms are dated, ours also had a strong scent/odor from either the carpets or the AC filter Forget brakefast and dining here, and head out to the ""Juice Bar"" or ""A Little Bird..."" for a healthy meal. La Jolla is a great place, and Windandsun Beach is lovely, just a few minutes away.",1
Curiosity90395,Rest and Relaxation,Great location. Great service. Friendly staff. Within walking distance to the beach & great restaurants. One recommendation for future customers - Try for a 2nd floor patio suite - the views are fantastic. 1st floor - views are good but not fantastic.,5
Diane,Hidden Gem in the heart of La Jolla,"This small resort truly is a retreat—-with the ocean a stone’s throw away. Walking path along ocean affords opportunity to watch birds, seals, and sea lions. We had a rental car, but only used once during the week. Many and varied restaurants within easy walking distance. Staff is extraordinarily accommodating and someone is always available to answer questions. Breakfast provided daily offers some variety and served for most of the morning. Property includes “cottages” and suites. All are aged, some dating back to the turn of last century. However, significant updating/rehab has been done and at least based on suite we had, would not have wanted any thing additional. Each unit/suite is unique. Nightly turndown with GREAT chocolates and handwritten evening thought is",1
crozen6,Exceptional,"We had a spectacular time at the Pantai Inn. Our room was warm and cozy. It was great eating cookies from the lobby, sitting in front of the fireplace and oceanview, and relaxing. We walked oceanside daily to watch the surfers and seals.",4
