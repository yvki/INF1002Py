0,plimina,5,Absolutely gorgeous,This place by far is the best kept secret in Southern California . The Pantai Inn  has minimal rooms which they could concentrate and focus on throughout your stay   There are so many different amenities here that you would not get in any other hotel. I recently met the owner her name is Sandy I have not yet met her husband the manager Mike 2 awesome friendly people they just wowed me. The complementary breakfast in the morning is far much better than a regular restaurant that you would go to for breakfast. The view was incredible directly across from the ocean with ocean views in most of the rooms This is a must you have to experience this Pantai Inn at least once.

2,sassytraveler0125,5,Amazing hotel and staff!!!,"My friend and I decided to go to Kota Kinabalu to unwind and relax after busy days at work... and I must say that this hotel made our trip amazing!!! Stayed here from Feb. 16 - 18, 2018. Didn't know that these dates are also exactly KK's holiday due to CNY. Perfect timing, right? No traffic congestion yeeey! :)  Anyways, we arrived here around past 8PM. Receptionists Rani and Stallone welcomed us. They are very accommodating and attentive to our needs (all the staff are nice actually! My bad for not getting all their names). During our stay, I often called the Reception due to some requests such as adaptor and hair dryer. I'm glad that they were able to provide all of these without any hesitations. Room is super clean! I am very particular with the bathroom cleanliness and they…"
3,Andersonsabroad,3,Clean nice rooms but very noisy,"The hotel had 2 large beds, was clean but unfortunately our room was by the lift which was noisy with guests coming and going. Plus nearby in the evenings it gets very noisy with either poor singers/karaoke etc. Plus a water pump going overnight. The seafront is about 5 mins walk away. Lots of shops and malls nearby. No onsite breakfast but lots of nearby local places. If you stay here then ask not to be near the lift. It was good value but too noisy for us"
4,lyc04,5,Clean and good location,"This was my second time visiting your hotel. I was happily surprised by the upgrade. The hotel look great after refurbishment. It was very clean and fresh, location is great and everything is within walking distance. Good value for money in the city centre of Kota Kinabalu."
5,Matt D,5,"Clean & Cheap, great location",Great central location across the road & round the corner from the airport shuttle bus. Loads of nearby restaurants and things to do. Reception staff were nice & cleaners always did a good job. Note the double rooms are much bigger than the queen size rooms & beds can be moved.
6,Dutch_traveler013,5,Excellent quality for money,We stayed with six people and all had clean rooms with comfortable beds. Staff speaks English and is ready to help. Hotel is located in the heart of the city centre with all attractions nearby.  Good value for money ik the city centre of Kota Kinabalu.
7,Terence Tan,4,Basic Venue at the Heart of the city,"The Hotel has really friendly staff. Near the hotel there are plenty of food places nearby and is easily accessible. The hotel was clean, smells clean and tidy. Free water and coffee. For a good 2 to 4 Nights stay to visit the city with a small budget, it is not a bad place to be in."
8,zarzadon,3,Basic hotel and value for money,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Location is at Gaya area. 10-15 min to Jesstleton Jetty and waterfront/night market. Lots of good restaurants around the area.  Our room was quite small but good enough since we were only in the room to rest and sleep. The room was cleaned everyday, but we found hair on the comforter which wasnt from us.   The staff were alright and accommodating enough. "
9,palma k,4,basic but nice,"Very basic hotel, but very clean and nice friendly staff. For this money you can't find better, I think. The Ferry station is close (15 minutes walk) to Pantai Inn. Manuka Island is a must, but don't wear a baseball cap on the ferry.... Wonderful experience, wonderful Borneo"

15,JoeSimcock,3,"Good location, average hotel","Stayed here for 3 nights. Staff on reception fine, some don't speak very good english. Rooms are cleaned everyday, basic but the usual amenities are supplied. Had some laundry done at the hotel, another guest said it's much cheaper up the road though. Wifi was very temperamental, not sure if that's just our room location. Would recommend to stay here if you're on a budget and need a basic room to stay in the centre of KK. "
16,ClarkeyR,3,Average room at decent price,"For 32 AUD per night for a double room, this hotel is good value. Location is great and everything is within walking distance. The room & be sheets are clean but agree with other reviews regarding the place needing a fresh paint. If you're looking for budget and want a step up from a backpackers, I would recommend pantai inn"
17,shahzan82,3,strategically located,"its a budget hotel with an excellent location. a door step to Gaya Street. walking distance to KK's many attraction, such as night market, shopping malls and eateries.easy to get a taxi. wi-fi is a bit lousy although the modem was located front of the room. the room was small and old tv with limited channel."
18,Drifter,4,Clean & great location,"Stayed here several times, although the room was small & outdated, it was clean. The best part about this hotel is location, location, location. Easy access to local eateries & shopping complexes, not to mention the Gaya Sunday Market is just right behind the hotel. Affordable rates too."
19,KrisD_pl,2,Outdated and dissapointing,"We spent 2 nights in room no 307. We made a booking in advance via booking.com thanks to the opinions and appealing price (MYR 87 per night for a double room). What we found there was hugely disapponting. The reception is quite nice and the service is good.   I'll start with the good things:  - the reception is quite nice and the service is good - location (hard to find better one)  - hot shower and good air-conditioning.   And now much longer list of drawbacks: - although hotel claims to be non-smoking, the first room we were offered (no 308) had terrible smell of cigarettes. After our intervention we were given room no 307 (the same in size) - size of the room - for 2 persons it was really tiny and not comfortable at all  - dirty walls in the room - no soundproof doors - when…"

25,Julienne L,4,Good location,This s quite a basic hotel but it is very reasonably priced and it is central Kota Kinabalu so handy for the harbour front and the  markets and restaurants.  It s about 15/20 minute drive from the airport -the cst if the taxi ride us 30 RM - about £5. The one down side  is that it was noisy at night as it is near a bar that has music till midnight.
26,1_Honest_Aussie,1,BED BUGS Alert.!!!  Stay elsewhere.!,Bed bugs.!!  Stay anywhere else.! We stayed at Pantai and the staff were lovely minus one. Our holiday involved a visit to the doctors due to bed bug attack. When we spoke to lovely staff they directed us to the female manager who quite honestly was uninterested and uncompassionate to our bed bug cause. She offered no compensation or care at all. It is a shame as as the staff were very friendly and helpful dispite their broken English.
27,Jparktravel,1,Pretty horrible,I agree with others when they say the location of this inn is it's only greatest feature. Otherwise the stay wa pretty horrible.  First of all the stink of cigarette smoke throughout the whole hotel is enough to give you constant nausea.  Second the walls are SO thin!  We couldn't sleep all night because we could hear every noise made by our neighbor!  I even went down stairs to ask whether it was a staff dorm as they had been up making washing sounds with the tv on and banterring from 9pm til 6am! They said it wasn't and told me they would ring the room... They didn't.  For 90rm it's reasonably priced but i would just pitch in that extra little money and stay somewhere decent so you don't have to stay awake all night or stress.
28,dhara08,4,Good location but with not so good room,"We stayed for only one night and the thing that we really like about the place is it's location because it is near the night market and also just a walking distance to wisma merdeka and bayview waterfront and other restaurants and establishments. We booked through booking.com and the frontdesk personnel are friendly, thought they know a little english so some questions they can't really answer it's a good thing  there's a Filipino standing by the frontdesk and he answered some questions, the receptionist originally gave us room on the first floor but the Filipino guy honestly admitted that the toilet is not functioning so they instead gave us room on the third floor. Upon entering the room the smell of the room gave me an headache so we bougth for a room freshener to the nearest…"
29,IGibbons,3,"Not too bad, but a bit dated","It's been a couple of years since I stayed here (March 2011), but I doubt much has changed in that time. Apologies for the late review. The hotel is well located, and less than 10 minutes walk to the promenade, Jessleton Jetty, main shopping malls and high streets. There are lots of good cafes and bars along the road the hotel i on. It's pretty basic and a bit dated, but reasonably clean and for the money you pay it's reasonable value. It's not a 5 star palace, but then again, you're going to pay far more for that kind of hotel. I stayed for 4 nights, it was ok for that duration, but if I was staying in KK for longer I'd probably pay a bit more for a resort type hotel with a pool...etc.  It's OK."

35,rebecca a,4,Good budget hotel,We stayed in July before climbing Mount Kinabalu. The rooms were basic but very clean. The location is great.   I would recommend getting a room with a window. There wasn't one available for us on the first night but we move the next day and it was much better.
36,abcdefg556,3,Holiday,"Close to all attractions Fillapine ,market walking distance,Famose Sunday market just at the back of the hotel. Close to food stalls and shops plenty of places to visit transport not a problem bus to main bus station across the road."
37,LouisLiew,4,Pantai inn,"I think pantai inn is a budget hotel nice location walking in short distant to mall and waterfront,  nice , friendly & polite for the receptionist, you also put your luggage before you check inn so that you can save your time going shopping and explore city instead of waiting check in. they also supplies hot water if you need so....have a nice trip..."
38,Liv,3,Not too bad,Arrived in KK after mid night and leaving to north early morning the next day so we decided to go cheap. Location was great. Very basic. The A/C control was not working. Very small room. Has running hot water. Quite clean. Staffs are helpful and smiley.
39,Bethhess00,4,Solid stay in KK--would recommend it!,"Friendly staff, good location, quiet at night, clean room with hot water shower--If 84RM/night is in your price range for a double room (no breakfast), then I would definitely recommend booking this place. Laundry is 8RM per kilo and can be done the same day. If you're interested in visiting an island in the national marine park while you're staying in KK, the jetty is less than a 10-minute walk from the hotel."

45,Jim28Manila,3,Nice Hotel,Hotel is very basic.  Clean room and with hot shower.  It is in the middle of the city and Gaya street is just a few steps at the back where you can buy stuff of all kinds on Sunday mornings.  Staff is friendly and can help you with bookings for local tours.  The hotel has no restaurant but eateries are all around the hotel.
46,myralakwatsera,4,Not bad at all.,"Good location, nice frienly staff, many restaurants close by, walking distance to most places and very reasonable price.  That is why this hotel is not bad at all.  In fact, it is quite good."
47,djpinks,4,"Great location, very accommodating staff","Stayed in Pantai Inn, KK Jan 27-30, 2012 and was booked by a friend( they do not have a website). Their location is central with restos around, a nearby supermarket, walking distance to Atkinsons Clock, Segawa walkway, Jesselton Ferry terminal and malls.  Great hotel and very accommodating staff."
48,Urdjuret,3,No Frills Comfort,"Can't beat the central location.  Stayed here for a couple nights and the hotel staff were more than friendly.  The hotel is starting to fade, and could use a face lift but it was fairly clean, hot water showers, and not musty.  No food, but plenty to choose from by way of a short stroll."
49,Jim28Manila,4,All good,"The room was RM83 per night and, as others have written, not very big but not really too small if you're not planning on staying in all day. Clean, maybe not the cleanest ever but certainly nothing that would bother me. Staff is friendly and helped me organize a day trip. Private shower. TV, although none of channels were in English except one connected to an Astro box in the reception, so that channel is chosen for all rooms downstairs. Phone in room. Location is great, although that is not a very big issue in KK. It's nice to be so close to the ferry terminal though, 10 min on foot. Free water. Nice Satay places right outside. No breakfast, maybe it was possible to buy, but there's places around."

55,Stoff101,3,Basic hotel in good location,"Stayed here on 2 separate ocations. Why did we come back? Well very good location and its quite cheap. The rooms are not that big, but for 2 persons its good. The wifi works great in the rooms. Leave your laundry in the afternoon and get it giftwrapped in the morning. One thing thou, the food isnt that good. There are plenty of restaurants around the corner."
56,traversata,4,Basic and Wonderful,"Yes, the rooms are teeny.  So much so, that you can shower and use the toilet at the same time.  However, I've had smaller rooms in London, where the experience was quite miserable.  What made this different?  The fact that they had very fast and consistent wifi, the cleaning service was spotless, and the restaurant directly connected to the hotel was one of the best Malay restaurants that we ate at, and it was cheap to boot.  O, silly me, AND the hotel was incredibly priced.  Freakin' incredible.  About $28USD/nt incredible.  O wait, I'm not done yet, did I mention the location is central to everything?  You've got the Filipino Market to the sw (which I did not find any Filipino food...curious), the Sunday (Gaya St) Market to the e, Jesselton Point to the n, and Centre Point…"
57,Thenewparadigm,4,"Basic, small, but perfect!","This hotel was great. Yes, the rooms are small, but why would anybody be spending time in them?! The staff were absolutely superb and so so friendly. Location good, just a few streets from the waterfront and the amazing night market. Clean rooms, tv set, air con, hot water, decent bathroom. When I go back to KK, I'll stay there again. Great value!"
58,,4,Good value for the room,"Made reservation thru agoda.  The Inn is located along the main road of the city and just a few blocks away from the Waterfront and several malls in the area.  Upon arrival, I presented my agoda booking with the receptionist.  I was given a key to a room and directed where to go.  I was confused because the room number printed on the key is 103 but I was told to get to the lift.  When I get to the lift, it became clear to me that the Ground Floor (G) is not the same as the First Floor (1).  So off we go to the 1st floor (which is actually on the second level) and to our Twin Room.  The plastic casing on the key chain functions as the key card for the power.  There are several switch panels in the room that can turn on/off the same set of lights  and the switch for the aircon was…"
59,,5,Fantastic option in KK!,"Pro: Staff really friendly. Pro: Staff very helpful. Pro: Clean Rooms. Pro: Excellent air-con. Pro: Great location. Pro: Hot water. Pro: Good sleep quality. Pro: Rooms 85 RM per night.  Con: Rooms small, but who comes to Borneo to sit around in their hotel room anyway?  Overall an excellent option in the heart of KK."
