0,christinegH9310JS,4,Disappointed with service and staff,"My daughter and I stayed at the hotel with our 16 lb. mini schnauzer August 16-18.  On the 18th, I was trying to use the self check out kiosk in the lobby to purchase some food, and had trouble with the scanner.  The three people working at check in desk offered no assistance.  Then suddenly a man came in with two pitbulls that were definitely over the 50 lb. weight limit in the dog policy.  Our dog and the pitbulls were barking at each other, and the man was struggling to control his dogs.  He dropped one of their leashes and the dog ran over to me, and jumped on me.  The dog continued to bark and act aggressively.  I screamed and picked up my dog.  No-one working at the front desk offered any assistance.  My dog was attacked six months earlier by a pit bull and had to get…"
1,Asma,5,Amszing experience,Hotel staff is amazing. Especially Juan who really has customer's consideration in his heart. Juan has been always smiling and trying to help us put throughout our stay at Indigo.  Looking forward to our ne t stay in this amazing hotel
2,Gwen R,5,Great stay and very accommodating!,Loved the staff! Juan was especially helpful with my baggage and sharing updates about the heatwave! What a great group of people that make your stay extra special! The lobby is so cute and I can’t wait to grab a drink in the bar!
3,Josh B,5,LA business meeting,Had to come for a business meeting here and loved the roof top! I enjoyed meeting and was really impressed by the professionalism of Juan S. Who really was such a help and friendly during my visit! Great vibes all around and will definitely be back again
4,Jenny W,5,Wonderful spacious rooms and valet / front desk service,I love the hotel indigo. The style of the hotel is relaxing and the aesthetic is simply stunning. Everyone was wonderful to work with and we even had some special needs that they helped us take care of. Valet is amazing… Jonathan was so helpful every day that I saw him there… Not only helping us but others. Neph (i’m not sure how her name is spelled but she was A doll and so helpful ) and Alex at the front desk along with everyone else is great… And the room service was absolutely spectacular. How to gorgeous room but the most amazing bathroom… And a spectacular view. Jenny
5,Alan H,1,Could have been great,"Objectively this is a very nice hotel but, bizarrely, they checked us out of our room and checked another couple in at 9am. (Who checks anyone into a hotel room at 9am).  So, this poor couple blasted through our ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign and woke us up! Hardly ideal. We then had to go and explain ourselves at the front desk as they couldn’t sort it out over the phone.  We were given some really random excuse that someone else (on the night staff) had mistakenly checked us out. They apologised at this point and offered us a $100 credit on our room. We had some breakfast that came to $50 but they still charged us the $44 for valet parking which didn’t seem to make any sense at that point.  Anyway, it was otherwise fine but this has never happened before to us so I feel we should…"
6,Tracy D,5,Juan went above and beyond!,"Juan was an incredible support for us getting ready for all of our guests. He was friendly, fast, and incredibly accommodating. One of the best hospitality experiences we have had in a while. Thanks Hotel Indigo!"
7,325duncans,5,Comfortable well located hotel,Hotel Indigo in DTLA is a lovely hotel - we had a warm welcome at check in and the staff were great throughout our four night stay.  I had dropped an email ahead of arrival and our requests had been taken into account which was brilliant.  Reception and bar area are fun and quirky; the rooms are spacious with well appointed bathrooms; and the rooftop pool was great.  The bar and restaurant are expensive - but to be honest no more so than the other hotels we stayed on our trip to California.  We had breakfast a couple of times and the food was excellent and presented really well.  Only negative was the pool bar only opening at the weekend - so on the Monday it was not easy to grab a drink when around the pool area.  The rooms were very comfortable and clean; we all slept well in…
8,Jojolapin,4,Very good hotel,"The hotel is super clean and the rooms too, everthing is modern. There is 24-hour security. The staff are friendly. Beds are comfortable, there is a good size fridge in the room and free coffee and tea. The seating area is small. The bathroom has a nice Italian shower, there is no bath. As was reported in the papers there are homeless everywhere in Los Angeles, even in the posh neighbourhoods. The street of the hotel is clear and clean, maybe because of the security. 20 min walk to the subway, 7th Street. The gym is well equipped and nice, there is lots of light. The pool area on the 4th floor is very comfortable with private access to cosy corners and plenty of sunbeds. Towels are provided. There are other areas that can be lit up with artificial fireplaces at night."
9,deel330,4,"Beautiful Hotel, Rip off for Drinks","This hotel is beautiful. The rooms are lovely, the place is very clean and the rooftop pool is amazing.  The downside is that this probably isn't the best location for a holiday base. It is near the metro and a reasonable sized shopping centre but I didn't feel very safe. The foodcourt at the shopping centre opens at 11am and closes at 7pm on weekends. Not ideal for a family backpacking probably more suited to couples.  There was no requirement to show my key or to use it to operate the elevators.  Staff weren't friendly. they weren't unfriendly either. Just completely disinterested.  The price of snacks in the lobby is scandalous. Ditto the rooftop terrace where you are not allowed to bring your own drink or food. I bought a bottle of water and two cokes from the rooftop bar,…"

16,萱 李,5,The LA indigo valet,The LA indigo valet is very friendly and kind! I felt so welcome when I first arrived! The best valet is the best in the LA city. The best  is Juan who look after me! Thank you so much Juan! Hope your kindness bring your the best.
17,Kishan P,5,Best bartenders in the country!,"If you don’t stop by here to get a drink with the best bartenders in the country then you are crazy. Pull up relax and chill! 10/10 review ask for Viet and Jordan! They are they best. They made our stay enjoyable! Don’t forget to stop by and talk to camila, she cool as he**!!"
18,ramby,5,The best hotel in LA!,"Always a treat staying at indigo downtown. The front desk was very efficient with Monique. Of course, my favorite as always is Ruben who handled my every request with promptness and courtesy. Breakfast was also delicious at the lobby. I will always stay here at this hotel."
19,Joyce261,4,Good modern hotel,"Well placed and modern hotel.  Large bedrooms with good sized beds and really comfortable pillows! Plenty of extras, coffee, toiletries.  We changed rooms as our first one smelled badly of weed.  No problem with reception staff.  Good secure underground car park.  Well placed and within walking distance of shops, restaurants and subway."

Thank you to Juan, Angel, Christian, Monique, and Dante for all your help and service. There were many more who helped us! Everyone was great! Thank you for a wonderful weekend. We will definitely be coming back to hotel indigo."
26,Geraldine55,5,Week in LA,"This is our final night after staying here a week for my first visit to LA. Lovely hotel with everything you need right here. Staff are fantastic and so helpful. Food and drinks very good and a fantastic assortment. Very easy to get to nearest station (10 min walk) if you want to get to Hollywood, Sunset Boulevard and Universal which we did. I loved chilling by the pool a couple of hours a day - again a fantastic bar man and good service. My daughter (who loves her sleep) said she’d miss the bed when we go home tomorrow! Would definitely recommend."
27,Leo,1,SCAM!,"So we needed to charge our Tesla. This place has a Supercharger in their parking garage, usually you can charge away since Tesla probably has worked something out with the owners of the garage. No. Not here. They want you to pay an additional $11 just to use the Superchargers.   It would've been a great experience, they have a full bar / restaurant that we could've tried and depending on the experience, would've considered staying there.  Since they want to rip people off, forget all that. Do you want $11 that bad? Or make more money while the car is charging? Oh well. Another scammy place to avoid while visiting Los Angeles. 1 Star and very well deserved!"
28,Drew W,5,A++ Service once again!,Just finished up another great stay at the Indigo & wanted to give a shoutout to Diamon & Tonya for going above and beyond for us & made our stay even better.   Definitely ask for them when coming to this hotel!  10/10 highly recommend :)
29,Matt R,5,Great room and service,Great service from the front desk to the valet people and the house keeping. I would love to stay to this place again. The rooms were clean and the attendant answered all my questions that i asked. Great ealking distance to crypto.com arena and la live

35,gltrottersfo,5,"Delightful, friendly, comfortable in downtown L.A.","A delightful surprise in downtown L.A. Very friendly service and fair price. Comfortable rooms with innovative interior design. Full gym and nice pool. Good food. My only suggestion: The hotel should provide early-morning coffee in the reception area, since the nearest open coffee shop is a bit far (and the hotel restaurant doesn't open until 6:30)."
36,Kelly M,3,Cute Downtown Hotel,"I needed a cute hotel for a quick getaway and this hotel fit the bill. It is located in downtown and super eclectic and unique. It is not a family friendly hotel, but perfect for a guys or gals getaway. They have a cocktail lounge and restaurant and bar. It’s close to the subway and a short Uber ride to everything.  I had booked the more expensive package that was supposed to include free breakfast, but it didn't. The hotel puts a hold of $100 per night on your card for incidentals. Room service for a plate of chicken, desert and a soda was $75! Breakfast was around $40 and it wasn’t all that great. The beds were not comfortable and the front desk staff were not all that nice.  Would I stay there again? Probably not. Comfortable beds and friendly staff are a must when traveling"
37,Kimberley c,1,Throw your money here,This is an expensive hotel run by untrained gum chewing teenagers. The front desk had no information regarding restaurants or bike paths and seemed asleep at the wheel. The breakfast menu is a joke and why pay money to be back at the high school cafeteria.
38,Enjoytripp,2,I don’t like here,"This hotel is definitely not worth of $350 per night. There were so many other options in LA. Now I am regretting why I picked this. Furniture are old, dirty and worn out. Shower booth is badly designed. Staffs are not professional and they don’t care about customers. After checking in, they texted me that I have to text them if I need anything. So I texted them to ask 2 towels and 2 forks. The front desk replied that a houseman would be with me shortly. But no one showed up for 50mins. So I texted again. They replied that they would inform a houseman about the towel but I have to pick up utensils in the lobby.  I had to wait for 50 mins for nothing!!! and they didn’t even apologize about it. Now I have to change clothes to pick up 2 disposal forks. I had to sleep here for…"
39,Connector586674,5,Great stay!,Phenomal customer from Nef and Andrea! Easy and accommodating!  This hotel was exactly what I was looking for in downtown LA. Room was also perfect. Service was great. Was easier and better priced than some of the other hotels in the surrounding area

45,Dwight B,5,Care and compassion,"I had a facelift surgery and I choose to stay here afterwards.  I stayed 2 days in after care then stayed here for 4 nights before my follow appt..  I was nervous at 1st, but that was wiped away as I checked in early, and knew I was not under the best conditions and made me feel like I was at home.  Marablle, Neff, Andy were so accommodating.  Also the bald guy( forgive I forgot your name) took great care of me. Extra pillows, towels, microwave. They even came by and checked on me to make sure I was okay. I had some family that didn’t call and check on me, but at the hotel indigo I was family during my time there as they checked in me.  Thank You 🙏🙏🙏, all for caring Loyal guest Dwight"
46,loiskeegan,1,Do not stay here!!,I booked this room 6 months ago and requested a high floor so I wont hear the loud LA traffic and homeless people parties  But to no Avail!!   Gave me 9th floor and said no guarantees on a high floor booking even though I booked way in advance    When I questioned the noise level I was accused of being a light sleeper from the receptionist!  No guarantees!  Not worth the risk!!
47,Kevin B,5,Absolutely Exceptional Hotel Staff,"Everyone here has been super nice, especially a bellman named Juan, who went above and beyond to help me find and transport packages for a critical business trip. Other hotel staff, Andy, Olivia, and Andrea were also great to interact with, top notch on the hotel side. The bar and dining side weren't up to the same level of performance, but would definitely stay in the hotel again."
48,Rae H,1,"Looks nice, but is cheap…. and LOUD.","The valet are all fantastic and the front desk staff has been pretty responsive. Other than that I won’t be staying here again. I am writing this from my room at 2 in the morning after being woken up by really loud music, I can hear it through ear plugs. Apparently security was sent up to check it out, but nothing has changed. The heater/ac unit is OFF and emitting some loud sounds as well. The noise is inescapable. I also read in a google review (after booking) that a reviewer was unable to sleep due to noise. Lastly, it is right next to the freeway so it is just not quiet, no matter what. It’s loud, period. Don’t come here."
49,Jacqueline R,5,Overnight stay for a concert,Hotel Indigo is amazing!!! The rooms are beautiful & clean & the views are amazing especially at night..Great staff!! ALEX in valet was very helpful and attentive..Had my car waiting in front for me as I came in and out..All it took was a phone call from my room..Definitely worth the price..I’ll definitely be back!!!!

55,Marla H,5,Amazing front Desk !,"First time here at this hotel and it is beautiful! The lobby is so cool, the front desk was so nice she greeted me and told us about food places around, she offered us a suite and gave us a discount for it. Her name is Nef I think, but she was so nice and welcoming. The room was so nice with a nice view ! We Loved it"
56,Vanessa G,3,Hotel indigo,"Juan the bellboy had great customer service, so did the valet folks and the cleaning staff was friendly. Front desk guy seemed to be having a bad day or maybe they’re always like that who knows. The rooms were nice at surface level but lacked specific cleanliness details, floor creaked at night and room was next to elevator if you are a light sleeper request they don’t book you next to elevators. The beds were comfy and the views were nice."
57,kryssykrys,4,Nice hotel,I wouldn't stay downtown again but this was a nice hotel the hotel was understaffed and took forever to bring things i needed the hotel had a nice bar downstairs can dress up and not even leave they have valet parking that we refused to use it was 50 a day we parked across at the lot that charged 15 a day no in and out so we stayed out till about 12 everyday so we wouldn't have to get up too early to take it out and start the day the room was nice has a fridge and the view from the room was amazing
58,Kevin E,5,A swinging Hotel in the Heart of the City.,"From entry to exit a delightful experience every minute we were there. The staff welcoming us to the caring and charming. Irwin, I believe was the front desk host who arranged us to have the best room in the house. To Olivia taking our photos in the lobby.   The location is unique with its 1920s themed decor. Just happened we were going to such a party that night, purely coincidence. It couldn’t have been more perfect.  It’s a lovely place, I’ll be back."
59,Dalton M,5,Gold Star Hotel!,Exceptional Stay! Appreciate the great hospitality while staying here the last couple of days. The hotel staff is always kind and go above the expectations of service! I appreciate them for being on top of everything from being to end of my stay. Thank you!
