0,Rafiq Irfan,4,Good location and helpful staff,"Very convenient location where you can find food and cinema nearby. Also not too far from other hotspot locations in Singapore.  Staff very helpful when you need some assistance. I have also accidentally left a valuable item upon checkout and the staff Mr Chester is very helpful in assisting me.  However, I wish the breakfast can be served slightly earlier as the time I had to leave for work and the breakfast is at the same time."
1,fmoulsen,5,Thank you IHG EXPRESS Orchard,I enjoyed my 10days stay at this hotel. Had small bumps on payment issue and the front desk staffs are really helpful and being so patience keeping up with me and my issues.  10/10 to the team esp. NAQIAH.  Breakfast was good too. Chef Ram did well serving us a very good breakfast with various options to choose for.
2,Fau,1,"Inferior Product, Low  Value for Money Hotel","The small sister from Holiday Inn did not look like the big sister at all. Quite disappointed to be honest. I dont even know why they got the SG Clean label whereas it was totally different than what i found.   First impression was the room was dirty, the main switch light had blood splattered, got hair stuck in between towels, lipstick mark on the coffee mug, stain marks on the bed sheet, room was heavy with dust, and worst of all?   Promise not kept. I rang the hotel before booking if the hotel is willing to put plywood board underneath the mattress (normally to give more support), the receptionist said YES. i put this condition in writing too at the time of booking, and when i checked in at the hotel, receptionist also said YES. I kept asking for it, after a week of keep…"
3,Itravel0ne,4,Convenient and good stay,"The location is great and centrally located. Easy access to the malls and eateries along Orchard road. Room is well design as typical of the HIE. Staff are friendly and can’t fault any of the service except that the phone and safebox in the room was not working when we checked in. But it was fixed after it was reported. Breakfast is good and sufficient. Timing of breakfast is crucial as you may not find seats at certain hours. Overall, it was a great stay."
4,Mystery,2,Need to improve,"Stay there for staycation 3 day 2 nights. The check in was fast however the front desk never brief us in detail about the facilities.  1 of the day our room was not clean,when we call the frontdesk they say is 3 day once. I paid 1 night $200+ and the hotel clean every 3 day.The manangement need to change this procedure.  "
5,Elizabeth L,2,First hotel I have stayed at that I had to make my own bed,Apparently due to covid housekeeping now only takes care of your room once every 3 days. We were told that we needed to ring reception to get on the housekeeping list so don't bother to hang the housekeeping required on the door. Very disappointing when you are an elderly couple No complaints about staff. Very helpful Breakfast was good but we will not be returning
6,alexserapio,5,Hospitable Staff,Very accommodating front desk staff-Mika and Gerald. Warm welcome from Sales-Ms. Su Han and Karen. Sumptuous Asian breakfast from Chef Ram and mainstay Wang. Very clean room and prompt service form housekeeping staff Kelly. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives.
7,Sundari,5,Duty Manager Naqiah& Nabila staff is friendly and helpful.,"im so happy i stay here with my family, Naqiah & Nabila staff is helpful and friendly, the breakfast was good and the enviroment clean and convient to mount elizabeth hospital and shopping malls.  i would love to come again to stay."
8,Entrepreneur,5,"Brilliant hotel, great people and second home!","If there is one hotel which one can come close to calling home its HolidayInn Express Orchard Road ,SG! The leadership of the manager in charge SuHan is commendable and the team to back the execution. When it comes to guests there is nothing that cannot be solved, whether food, or a cab or just help in moving around. The location is simply the icing on the cake. Clean, Comfortable and Value for the experience!"
9,Joel Cruz,4,Friendly & warm staff  & you feel at home!,"Location of this hotel is perfect if you love to shop whether high end or not. Situated near Orchard road, walking distance to restaurants, shops, hospital, convenient stores. Staff are very accommodating to the extend that they offer free bottled water to guests. Free breakfast from 6:30-10:30am and you can have it take away if you wish. Unfortunately, there is no swimming pool, no bath tub in case that’s your requirement. I was not able  to check if there is a fitness room. Over all, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and all staff show their smile while entertaining us. We will definitely patronize this hotel again. Thank you so much Holiday Inn Express!"

17,UpsidedownWonderer,5,Best Holiday Inn Express that I've Stayed In!,"I stayed at this hotel with family with my IHG points redemption.  We chose this hotel due to its location, as it is superbly located near Somerset MRT station and Singapore's finest shopping malls.  Upon check-in, it was clear that service is absolutely spot on - professional, efficient and courteous.    Adding another feather to this hotel's bow is the size of its rooms.  The connecting rooms that we got was one of the biggest rooms I have seen for a HIE (bigger than some HIs in Europe!).  The clean and ample space came with courteous room service staff.    Another pleasant surprise was that the breakfast menu varies throughout the week with local specialties.  The staff managed to find seats for us even during its peak hours.   Overall, this hotel is a credit to the IHG brand…"
18,Roam780091,5,Holiday Inn Staff,"Service was very good and overall very convenient - had a good time interacting with Mong Thuy. She is efficient and meets our needs. Always happy and smiling, really felt welcome during our stay at Singapore."
19,TC Yin,3,Excellent staff service,"I highly commend on the great team work during the morning rush hour,ensuring hotel patrons get their seats, clearing the tables, serving them. Waitress Wang is so pleasant. Everyone served wtih a smile. I love the customer service of the staff. The hotel itself isn't so great but the service more than compensates for the buidling. As they say, people make the difference.  And it was wonderful to see interacial and intercultural harmony within the staff.  I saw Chinese, Malay, Burmese and Indian staff working well. Truly unity in diversity."

26,CCHSingapore,5,IHG Never Disappoints,"To be honest, I have never taken notice of this hotel till I stayed here. Located off the main road, I am quite thankful it is away from the hustle and bustle. In fact, it is an oasis of peace and quiet.  Checking in was easy and efficient, and the process was completed in less than 10 minutes. I had asked weeks before my arrival if my bicycle can be placed in the storage room, and the hotel nicely obliged. Nurul, at the front desk, made me feel welcomed quite immediately. I was told that to beat the crowd, having breakfast before 8am would be best, and that was what I did the morning after. I was very happy with my assigned room. It had all the guestroom and bathroom amenities a guest would possibly need.   Scan a QR code in the room and information ranging from food menu…"
27,Been Around,5,Amazing Stay with Standout Team Members,I would like to give the highest praise to the team here who went out of their way to address my needs during my stay.  I would like to particularly highlight the efforts of Mr. Jan Faizal Abu Bakar who went above and beyond to make me feel like a valued guest and customer.  In the last nine months I have stayed at ten different IHG properties.  This experience is one that will standout.  I shall be back!

35,alanthegreat,4,Spacious for a Holiday Inn,"The room is pretty spacious compared to other Holiday Inns I stayed. Simple but adequate. Room is well taken care of. Bed is definitely comfortable. I dislike the bathroom. The door either close for the shower area or the entire bathroom. If u close for the shower area, it means the toilet bowl area is exposed. If u close the entire bathroom, u gonna wet the entire toilet too. It just doesn't make sense. Also, the room is a bit too close to the office building opposite. I can see workers hustling at their desk. I'm not sure if I am motivating them or demoralising them by having a vacation on a weekday!"
36,SOE E,1,Quanrantine 10 days with bad experiences,"I am on doubt about the good comments from Trips apps. Below are experinces which i met on first and second day of quarantine.   Days 1: Due quarantine 10days, we are arranged to holiday inn for SHN. On first day of check-in, I met a male chinese security staff here who spoke to me rudely and order me not to sit on the chair same row with my spouse (even with 1 m apart). Out of this,  when I enquire on SHN information regarding optional dedicated facilities matter but he replied with he dont know what is that rudely which has made us feel uncomfortable. He even approached me for asking  why i looked at him. Really like a gangster.  Day2: call to receptionist to ask for more mineral water but she is telling me that singapore water is clean and mineral water is second option…"
37,Sirjit,5,"Great service, Comfortable rooms","Was on QO for 7 nights but the staff (reception, security, housekeeping, F&B etc) provided such great service and were so accommodating to my needs. Really appreciate that they went out of their way to ensure my stay was as comfortable as it could be. The rooms are comfortable and everything was in working order. The meals were just fantastic- the staff allowed me to chose my cuisine everyday (just needed to give 24 hours notice)  Thank you very much for making my stay so wonderful."
38,Sun,5,Quarantine Stay,"When we received the quarantine order, we were worried about which facility we would be staying in, especially regarding the cleanliness and food provided.   It was a huge relief stepping into a clean, big and comfortable room which would be our home for the next 10 days. The room looked very new and was equipped with all necessary amenities and most importantly, fast Wi-Fi. Fortunately, our room was brightly lit so the sun could shine in at times.  We were impressed with how tasty the meals were.  We could see the effort put into preparing the meals and encouragement notes. Kudos to the chefs and staff!   The hotel team was polite and friendly. They were very responsive, attending to our requests promptly and patiently.   Thanks for making our quarantine stay a pleasant one.…"

I'm an IHG Rewards Club member so I knew service would be top-notch. The entire process was so efficient, thanks to the SG govt and all the staff throughout. Truthfully, I wasn't disappointed, room is impeccably clean. Could hoped for a better view though, but who would complain for a free ""staycation"".

This is very nice, my friends r all happy receive it. I wil recommend this place for foreigners as the staff r really helpful. I do hope the team wil stay positive, stay safe, during this pandemic."
59,plimtc,2,Let down by consistently late meal deliveries,"Was assigned to serve my quarantine here for 14 days. Small but comfortable room. There are set meal times and the main let down was the consistently late delivery of the meals, at times up to 45 mins - 2, sometimes 3 out the 3 meals each day for the past 6 days so far have been late. Called the reception each time it was late and the replies were the same - it's on the way, coming up soon, sorry - will inform the manager etc. Can accept the occasional delay but every day for 6 days? Wonder if that will be the case for the remaining 8 days staying here. Being quarantined is already tough and to have this happening made it worse. Hope that the management can address this soon."
