0,d g,2,Great location but that's about it,"Pokey rooms, one working lift for 38 floors, ~15 minute queues for elevator. A lot of money for over filled lifts and an average at best stay. We had thought this would be a good candidate for our upcoming reunion. With no good way to get to and from the rooms, it clearly is not on the list."
1,Sina,1,The worst stay ever,"I booked this hotel through Booking.com. I filtered for 4-star hotels and this property showed up. However, when I got there, I realized that the hotel is 3-STAR. I contacted the property manager and he also confirm that the hotel is 3-star. Here is his reply ""We are actually a 3-star hotel, We are rated as a 4- star hotel due to guest reviews!""  The hotel room is old and dirty, with a tiny bathroom, no safe box in the room and they do not provide breakfast. The air conditioner was making a shrieking noise. So, be aware that the hotel is actually WORSE than a 3-star hotel.   I contacted booking.com and they said they are not responsible for the star rating. Property managers also ignored my messages, and simply ruined my honeymoon. Please see the photo that I posted with this…"
2,Rob M,3,Parking will cost you.,"Price was fantastic. Room was basic. There was a pull out couch that turned into a bed. Great views from the front, but really no views from the back of the hotel. Parking is a pain. You have to walk a few blocks and pay $55 a night. Not the worst option, but keep in mind it is downtown. Staff was friendly and helpful. "
3,Emmanuel R,4,Well located in the loop,"I went there for a business trip. The hotel is clean, ideally located in the loop along the river. Everything is reachable by walk. My room was a little bit too small with a small window. At that time the breakfast was served in the room but was quite good."
4,Adam F,4,"Great Location, Decent Hotel","The location of the hotel is perfect, easily within walking distance of public transportation for attractions and airport connection. The simple offerings of the hotel are just as advertised, however the elevators are confusing and a hassle.   Only one of the elevators for Floors 12 and above was working during my stay, and this often meant 5 minute waits to go up or down  Otherwise the stay was perfect and the view from the 30+ floors Is great"
5,rktrump,5,Will absolutely stay here again,"I would absolutely stay here again. I sprung for a room with a view of the river. That means I paid more for this hotel than I typically like to for a place where I just need to lay my head. But it turns out it was totally worth it.   The view was downright amazing - and so peaceful to look at before heading to bed each night. My 9-year-old son particularly loved this routine.   And, the location is great. I may have planned to be out all day, but with this awesome central location, I could pop by the hotel if I needed to in the middle of our adventures.  Hardly needed the staff, to be honest. But the couple times I did need something (extra pillows and blankets), they came straight to my room.  I read some other reviews that made me think the room would be tiny. It wasn't at…"
6,Andrea L,1,Horrendous,"We were so excited to find such a seemingly nice hotel bailable for a “last minute” booking.  We called to insure an early check-in due to our flight arrival being in the morning. We were told we could check in at 11:00. At 11:00 we were told 1:00, then at 1:00 we were told 3:00.  We got to the hotel at 2:30 and were told that a room was available and it was an “upgrade”.  We paid for a king room with room for a fold out or pack-n-play. The room we were given (704) was extremely tiny, no room for any additional bed, and the window was smaller than a jail cell.  Attaching a photo of our “upgraded king bed”, that was 2 twin beds pushed together.  There was no breakfast available, the water machine on the floor didn’t work, and we weren’t provided any of the requests we asked for. …"
7,manuh620,4,Location is great,The hotel is very well situated for a trip to Chicago. Breakfast included shouldn’t be booked. It is not worth it. It is a hassel with the vouchers (usd 25) and fairly expensive for the choice and service you get.
8,Me_n_my_rucksack,5,"Exactly what we wanted....  perfect location, clean comfortable and friendly hotel.","When visiting a City you are unfamilliar with it can be hard to trade off price against quality when you know very little about the neighbourhoods etc...  we struck very lucky with the Riverside as the price was very reasonable and the location perfect.  A 5 or 10 min stroll from Clark on the Blue CTA line the Riverside is located (as the name implies) on the riverside - when you walk out of the front door the view is a real wow....  its within walking distance everything downtown.  The location really is spot on.    Check in is supposedly carried out via terminals in the lobby, but one of the friendly folks went through it with us.  The Building is historic - with a genuine historic feel to it in the entranceway -  which could mean dated I guess  - but there is absolutley…"
9,susan,4,"Excellent location, comfortable stay","River Hotel is in an excellent location for downtown and all its attractions. Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable. We appreciated the free laundry, the gym and the club room for relaxing during the day. The only thing that could have been improved was the room decor which was dated and a bit gloomy. "

15,Hey_girl_hey86,5,Location!,We stayed here for Monsta X concert at the Chicago Theatre. The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect. It’s right in the middle of everything you could need. We parked about 3 blocks away and never needed to drive the entire 4 day stay. Food-entertainment-parks-Navy Pier- you name it. It was absolutely the best place for the money. Surprisingly quiet at night too! We didn’t hear a thing from neighbors or outside. 
16,Pete S,5,Location,"Great location if interested in Mag Mile and Loop. Available river view rooms. Hotel staff is friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. Check in is easy with Club Quarter App. Easy check out as well. Close to great restaurants and activities. Highly recommended for great value."
17,Michele R,1,Stay away. Overpriced for what you get,One of the ugliest hotels I've ever stayed in.  The price is absolutely not justified.  Breakfast was not available and we were given vouchers for the restaurant next door which weren't enough.  The safe was missing.  Ugly room with an old bathroom with shower with plastic curtain and no shower gel.  No room cleaning service (unacceptable).  We asked for two separate beds and they gave us a normal bed and a sofa bed with a mattress full of humps where it was not possible to sleep.  Stay away
18,Paulade,3,"Location, location !!!",Hotel is in a great location !! Set on the south bank of the river it’s in the perfect place to explore the north side or the south side !! The room we had was really small with a window (but no view) If the price is really good then it’s a good option !!
19,Alexandra S,5,Ronnie and the QR code,"Ideal location. Dream view. Comfortable and spacious rooms. I'm not sure that the outsourced breakfast orderable from a QR code and delivered to your room is progress, especially when it is over 30mn late. But this was compensated by ""smooth groove"",  jiving Ronnie's warm welcome. He greets you with a smile, a joke, a song, and has solution for everything in ""less than one minute"". It was lovely being greeted in the evening on my way in to the hotel by ""Welcome back, Milady!"" In these days of QR codes, this quality of human service is greatly appreciated."

25,maumaujr,5,Location versus price,The best location in Chicago for a very low price... In front of Trump Tower. Close to a lot of atractions! We do almost everything on foot. The best choice at the Loop. Everything was grade 10 (from 0 to 10)!
26,04Stephanie2022,4,Good hotel for short trip,I came here for a weekend birthday trip. Room wasn’t the biggest but for only two people it got the job done. We spent about 4 hours a day (aside from sleeping) in there and it didn’t feel cramped at all. 
27,melodiegarrett,4,Perfect Location,"The location if this hotel is wonderful.  Easy access to the many sites to see.  The hotel staff was VERY accommodating and helpful.  This may be an older hotel compared to most and we did have some trouble with our room, but we were moved to a different room."
28,Johan F,4,"Perfect location, value for money",Excellent location at the river. Close to magnificent mile and the loop. Room well appointed and clean. Somewhat low pressure in the shower. No cleaning on daily basis due to Covid regulations. Self check-in very simple and quick. Recommended.
29,kellygumps1975,5,Great hotel great price,This was an amazing hotel for the price.  Very comfortable beds and pillows(with back issues this is HUGE) there is no resturant but a great roof top right next door. Very clean and easy to navigate.  Just remember there is an amazing river view(friends had that room we had city view) so ask for the river rooms 604 for sure had a great view! City view was good also but I went for the green river! Thank goodness friends got the river view so we could see it from above

35,TravelingWithJ,5,Quaint hotel in the heart of Chicago,"Stayed 2 days for a conference. Historic building conversion with great access to Michigan Ave. Quiet, updated room, comfortable bed and PILLOWS. Easy app check-in, good WiFi, and chilled purified water on the floor was a plus. Would stay again without hesitation."
36,craol02,5,Great hotel,The staff was phenomenal. The room superseded my expectations. It was amazing. Only issue I would say is the beds are very firm and was a bit uncomfortable for my husband and I. Everything else was fantastic. 
37,asalgad01979,5,Cozy and luxurious.,"Room was cozy, clean and stocked. Staff was polite, welcoming and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back. Fitness gym, coffee in the rooms, coffee in club living room. Bottled water accessible on every floor as well as ice. It was great."
38,juancovault,4,The River Hotel,"It has a beautiful view. The room was small, but clean. They offer coffee and other drinks free of charge on 2nd. floor. The staff were nice! I just wish the bathroom was better. However, it was clean."
39,r0nyd0s02003,3,Good location and facilities,"In the downtown center where you can walk to many landmark. Water station at every floor, guest laundry is free. Elevator were old and sometimes problem happened, hope can be maintained better.  Parking always an issue in downtown... Can be very expensive, get ready to walk further to get a cheaper parking slot"

46,Madaline P,2,Pictures on line do not reflect realty," Check in/check out-staff didn't offer up any information about the hotel and its amenities. We had to change our room to a larger room last minute to add our son but was never told that we would be charged extra for an additional person in a larger room that was supposed to accommodate 3 people. The pull out bed had no blankets, called for a blanket, waited an hour then went down to the front desk to ask about the blanket in person since we were ready to go to sleep. The pillows were hard as rocks. There was no light in the area of the room where the pull out bed was. I moved one of the lamps by our bed to the pullout bed area and noticed the lamp shade was broken and the screw that holds the shade on was gone. When opening the door to our room, we were on the 9th floor room…"
47,Lissie,5,Coming Back!,"I will like to start by saying that I can't wait to go back! Chicago is my only favorite city in the USA. The view to the river was amazing! Location was an A+ being close to most attractions at walking distance. A 7 eleven around the corner was convienient as well. The check-in was easy through a kiosk and if any issues, they are right there to help you. If you park at 20 E Randolph St. self-parking, the hotel will give you a discount and you pay only $25 for 24hrs. For me, that is a good deal for being parked right in the city. This parking lot is a 6 minute walk from hotel. The hotel and parking lot is a short walking distance to Boat tours, River walk and rest. (accross the street) Nutella, Cloud Gate and other attractions. The hotel was bulit in 1928 and you can tell buy…"

49,tcmalsch,4,Great location,"Enjoyed our view and location. We were next door to London house and across street of Trump building!

We booked a Superior Queen room and it included a kitchenette (mini fridge, microwave and a coffee machine) and a sofa and was spacious  The shower has a flexible hose which I like better than what most US hotels.have. We liked that the hotel has water station with refillable bottles on each floor - kudos to the hotel for being environmentally friendly  The location is great - close to the Riverwalk, the lake and Millennium park. Also the staff is professional, helpful and friendly. Good value for money."
56,chicagoans,5,Great Stay Near River!,"We stayed at the River Hotel after a wedding, and before the Chicago Triathlon. The front desk staff was very accommodating and friendly. They were flexible with our checkout time after the race, and very nice about checking our bags after that. They even let us check a bike :)  I would definitely stay here again! "
57,GDSM2016,1,Avoid it!!,"Avoid this hotel at any cost!!! Even though it looks clean and it’s location is superb, THEY DONT CLEAN THE ROOMS. We needed to clean ourselves. The excuse? The pandemic. Pandemic is no excuse for being filthy. Personnel is very friendly though. Anyway, I’m not staying here anymore and I recommend anyone not to as well."
58,Pennie41,2,The rooms,"This hotel allowed dogs, which was not a bad thing. However, my room has a dried urine spot on the floor. I was told (at check-in) that housekeeping doesn't go into every room and that if my room needed anything to call and let them know. The carpet in the rooms need to be cleaned after a family leaves that has a dog."
59,Tania M,4,Great location!,Great location for an affordable price.  Excellent customer service and fast check in and check out.  We had an amazing view from our room to the river.  Parking available with valet  parking service few blocks away. We will stay at The River hotel again for sure!
